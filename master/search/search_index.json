The discussions below are taken from a training course on compound flooding simulation. A common, convenient method for introducing river flows into watershed in SCHISM mesh is via the point source/sinks as shown in Figure 8 . Together with proper parameter choices (e.g., a small minimum depth of 10-5m, a fully implicit scheme, a large bottom friction with proper vertical grid to allow for 2D representation in the watershed etc) this usually works fine for smaller rivers. For large rivers, the open-boundary approach (i.e., river channels as open boundary segments) is the preferred method. In general, the point source approach injects flow via the continuity equation alone without providing extra momentum (note that the volume sources/sinks are added to the RHS of Eqs. 2 and 3 but not in the momentum Eqs. 1 , and thus it will take the system some time to adjust internally to set up the flow from the pressure gradient. Because of this drawback, large elevations may be found near the injection points, especially during initial ramp up or during high and rapidly varying flow periods. This symptom can be exacerbated by the following missteps: Pairs of source and sink in close proximity (Figure 9 a). Users should combine these pairs; Steep slopes near boundary with coarse resolution (Figure 9 b); Inverted bed slopes near the injection location (so the flow has to overcome gravity; Figure 9 c); Poorly ventilated \u2018dead-end\u2019 (Figure 9 d); Undulating channel (\u2018water fall\u2019; Figure 9 e). The model is stable, but interpretation of results may be problematic in those cases. Besides more grid work in those spots, using open-boundary segments can help. Also one should really exclude transient responses during ramp-up period in computing the maximum elevation to allow the system time to adjust. Also don\u2019t forget that sometimes the rainfall (which can also be introduced as sources) on high mountains should result in high surface elevations there, which are realistic. To get accurate results in the hydrologic regime, it is also important to resolve channels to avoid blocking flows. Semi-automatic mesh generation tools have been developed specifically for this purpose; see this chapter . Coupling of hydrologic model (National Water Model in this case) with SCHISM. The river network (lines) intersects SCHISM land boundary, and the river flow is introduced at the intersection points (sources for inflow and sinks for outflow). Pathologic cases for hydrologic flows. Tsunami simulations \u00b6 Your can diwnload a sample tsunami run (impact of Alaska tsunami waves on Cannon Beach, OR) at http://www.ccrm.vims.edu/yinglong/wiki_files/tsunami_ex15.tgz Note that the files are compatible with the serial version of SCHISM, but the idea for parallel version is similar. The operational time step for tsunami applications is generally in the range of a few seconds because of the constraint from shorter wavelength and inundation processes. You'll need higher mesh resolution also to satisfy the inverse CFL criterion ( CFL>0.2 ). The inundation results may also be sensitive to the min. depth used in the run (1cm in this example). If you use the newer parallel version, you can also use a 2D model with a proper Manning coefficient. Typically you need to follow these 2 steps in tsunami simulations: Deformation run (EX15/Def/ in the sample run): this simulates the earthquake and the set-up of the initial surface waves. For this you need: a) `bdef.gr3` (refer to the user manual) which specifies the total seafloor deformation. b) turn on the hotstart output handle, and `dt=1s, ibdef=10, rnday=1.158e-4` c) We typically run this stage for 10 sec duration and at the end of the run you'll find an output files called `10_hotstart` which is then used as hotstart.in for the next (propagation and inundation) stage. d) In addition, use `mod_depth.f` (inside the bundle), which takes info in `bdef.gr3` and `hgrid.gr3` (pre-earthquake depths) to generate hgrid.new (post-earthquake depths). The latter is used in the next stage. For completeness you need to attach the boundary condition part (`b.tmp` in the bundle) of `hgrid.gr3` to the end of `hgrid.new`; Propagation and inundation stage (EX15/ in the sample run): this run continues from the deformation run above with no further seafloor movement. You'll notice that many input files are identical to the Def/ run, but be careful of differences in hgrid.gr3 (linked to Def/hgrid.new) and param.in (imm=0 etc). a) For this run we also turn off the advection in the open ocean (up to say 60m isobath) because it's negligible there (`adv.gr3`) - this bypasses the inverse CFL criterion and allows you to use a coarser resolution in deeper ocean. b) Also note that `hotstart.in` is from the previous stage. After the run is done you can look at global outputs (elevation, depth-averaged velocity etc). The maximum elevation ( maxelev.gr3 ) and depth-averaged velocity ( maxdahv.gr3 ) are also part of the outputs (for parallel versions, use /src/Utility/Combining_Scripts/combine_gr3.f90 ). The maximum inundation can be easily computed from maxelev.gr3 .","title":"Case studies"},{"location":"case-study.html#hydrologic-flow","text":"Simulation of hydrologic flow in watershed, with bottom elevation above sea level (thus strong wetting and drying) and with complex river channel network, is challenging.

Bug fixes and major algorithmic changes \u00b6 R5178 : fix bug of saturate DO in ICM R5187 : incorporated dry bnd treatment from bndry (c/o Jens Wyrwa). However, to get good volume conservation it's best to keep all open flow bnd's wet all the time as before; R5191 : fixed a bug in iwind_form (accidentally re-init'ed after reading); R5202 : fixed a bug on negative ICM tracer concentration - check negative values before sending back to hydro. R5204 : a new option to control behavior of btrack when trajectory hots an open bnd (set vel=0 and exit). Goal is to eventually use this as default; 64b7181 : fixed an efficiency issue and added nc checks in ptrack3 (c/o Marcel Rieker) 2138e77 : Fixed a major bug introduced during reshuffling of _init for PDAF: need to call nodavel before sflux, as uu2,vv20 are needed there. 5ff2198 : revamped AGE module. B.C. now all should use 0. Only 0 and 1 should be used in AGE_hvar_[1:ntr/2].ic , where ntr is @ of age tracers, and the code will 'hold' concentration at 1 at those prisms (level specified in param.nml) that have 1 as i.c.

Domain partitioning \u00b6 The domain is first portioned into non-overlapping sub-domains (in element sense; see Figure 3 ) using ParMETIS. Then each sub-domain is augmented with 1 layer of ghost elements. This is accomplished by the call partition_hgrid() early in the main program. After calling aquire_hgrid(.true.) immediately after that, the elements, nodes, sides in each augmented and non-augmented (i.e., without ghosts) domains are shown in Figure 3 . The corresponding variable denoting number of Elements, Nodes, and Sides are given in the following table. Intuition is typically followed although there are exceptions as will be described below. Global Local non-augmented Ghost Augmented Elements ne_global ne neg nea=ne+neg Nodes np_global np npg npa=np+npg Sides ns_global ns nsg nsa=ns+nsg The call to ParMETIS routine is as follows - call ParMETIS_V3_PartGeomKway ( vtxdist , xadj , adjncy , vwgt , adjwgt , wgtflag , & numflag , ndims , xyz , ncon , nproc , tpwgts , ubvec , options , & edgecut , part , comm ) p : # of processors; n : total # of vertices (local) in graph sense; m : total # of neighboring vertices (\"edges\"); double counted between neighboring vertice u and v. ncon : # of weights for each vertex. int(in) vtxdist(p+1) : Processor j stores vertices vtxdist(j):vtxdist(j+1)-1 int (in) xadj(n+1), adjncy(m) : locally, vertex j 's neighboring vertices are adjncy(xadj(j):xadj(j+1)-1) . adjncy points to global index; int(in) vwgt(ncon*n), adjwgt(m) : weights at vertices and \"edges\". Format of adjwgt follows adjncy; int(in) wgtflag : 0 : none ( vwgt and adjwgt are NULL); 1 : edges ( vwgt is NULL ); 2 :vertices ( adjwgt is NULL ); 3 : both vertices & edges; int(in) numflag : 0 : C-style numbering from 0; 1 : FORTRAN style from 1; int(in) ndims : 2 or 3 (D); float(in) xyz(ndims*n) : coordinate for vertex j is xyz(j*ndims:(j+1)*ndims-1) (C style); ndims*(j-1)+1: ndims*j (FORTRAN style); int(in) nparts : # of desired sub-domains (usually nproc ); float(in) tpwgts(ncon*nparts) : =1/nparts if sub-domains are to be of same size for each vertex weight; float(in) ubvec(ncon) : imbalance tolerance for each weight; int(in) options : additonal parameters for the routine (see above); int(out) edgecut : # of edges that are cut by the partitioning; int(out) part() : array size = # of local vertices. It stores indices of local vertices. Arrays and constant \u00b6 llist_type :: iegl(iegb) : iegb is a global element #. If the element is resident (not ghost), iegl(iegb)%rank=myrank , and iegl(iegb)%id = local element index , and iegl%next=null . If iegb is a ghost, then iegl list has two entries: myrank and the rank where iegb is resident. All processors have this info, but the lists are different (1st entry is usually myrank etc). llist_type :: ipgl(ipgb) : ipgb is a global node #. Use this list only when the node is resident (not ghost); it\u2019s confusing when ipgb is ghost. If ipgb is resident, ipgl(ipgb)%rank=myrank , and ipgl(ipgb)%id = local node index . ipgl%next%next%next.... is the linked list, with ranks in ascending order. Unless ipgb is an interface node (i.e., resident in more than 1 process), the list has only 1 entry. All processors have this info, but the lists are different (1st entry is usually myrank etc). llist_type :: isgl(isgb) : isgb is a global side #. Similar to ipgl , if the side is resident (not ghost), isgl(isgb)%rank=myrank , and isgl(isgb)%id = local side index . isgl%next%next... is the list, with ranks in ascending order. All processors have this info, but the lists are different (1st entry is usually myrank etc). int :: ielg(ie), iplg(ip), islg(isd) : The global element index of local element ie in the augmented domain. Similar for the other two (nodes/sides). int :: iegrpv(iegb) : The rank # for global element iegb (before augmenting the domain). Used mainly in partitioning the grid. Arrays that have similar meaning between global and local aug. domains, i.e., they do not have problem of getting outside the aug. domain: i34 , elnode (old name: nm ), elside ( js ), ssign , snx , sny . Arrays that need special attention in the aug. domain - int :: ic3(1:i34(), ie) \u2013 positive if the neighbor element is inside the aug. domain as well (and in this case it is the local index of the neighbor element); 0 if (global) boundary; negative if the neighbor element is outside the aug. domain and in this case, the absolute value is the global element index. int :: nne(ip) \u2013 total # of neighbor elements around local node ip , including those outside the aug. domain (i.e., same as nnegb() ). int :: indel(1: nne(ip),ip) \u2013 surrounding element indices. If inside aug. domain, this is the local element index; if outside, this is the negative of the global element index. int :: iself(1: nne(ip),ip) \u2013 same as global iselfgb , i.e., the elemental local index for node ip in neighbor element indel() (even if it is outside). int :: nnp(ip) \u2013 total # of surrounding nodes for node ip , excluding all nodes outside the aug. domain. For SCHISM, include all nodes outside. int :: indnd(1: nnp(ip),ip) \u2013 list of surrounding nodes, excluding all nodes outside the aug. domain. For SCHISM, all nodes outside will have negative global index returned. int :: isdel(1:2,isd) & isidenode(1:2,isd) \u2013 order of the two adjacent elements follows global indices, and so the vector from node 1 to 2 in isidenode(1:2,isd) forms local y-axis while the vector from element 1 to 2 in isdel(1:2,isd) forms local x-axis. Therefore either of isdel(1:2,isd) can be negative. The element index is local (positive) if it is inside the aug. domain; otherwise the minus of global element index is returned. The local side isd is on the boundary if and only if isdel(2,isd)=0 , and in this case, isdel(1,isd) must be inside the aug. domain (i.e., positive) (if isd is resident). If isd is resident and not ghost, isdel() has the same meaning as serial code, i.e., is(1,isd)>0 (inside the aug. domain), and isdel(2,isd)>=0 , and isd is on the boundary if and only if isdel(2,isd)=0 . double :: delj(isd) \u2013 meaningful only if isd is resident. Boundary arrays : Most arrays point to global bnd segment #. Most B.C. arrays are global as well. nope_global \u2013 total # of open bnd segements in the global domain. nope \u2013 total # of open bnd segements in the aug. domain. iopelg(1:nope) \u2013 returns global open bnd segment # for a local open bnd segment. iopegl(0,k) - # of local fragmentations of global open bnd segment k. iopegl(j,k) - local segment # of jth ( 1<=j<=iopegl(0,k) ) fragmentation of global open bnd segment k. nond(1:nope) \u2013 total # of open bnd nodes on each segment. The corresponding global array is nond_global() . iond(nope,1: nond(1:nope)) \u2013 list of local node indices on each open bnd segment. The corresponding global array is iond_global() . nland - total # of land bnd segements in the aug. domain. nland_global is global. nlnd(1:nland) - total # of land bnd nodes on each segment. ilnd(nland,1: nlnd(1:nland)) \u2013 list of local node indices on each land bnd segment. nosd(nope) (ELCIRC) - # of open bnd sides on each segment. iosd(nope, 1: nosd(nope)) (ELCIRC) \u2013 list of open bnd side on each segment. noe(nope) (ELCIRC) - # of open bnd elements on each segment. ioe(nope, 1: noe(nope)) (ELCIRC) \u2013 list of open bnd elements on each segment. isbe(2,1:nea) (ELCIRC) \u2013 if the element is on the local open bnd, this returns the local segment # and element #. 0 otherwise. isbs() (ELCIRC) \u2013 similar to isbe . isbnd(-2:2,ip) (SCHISM) - If ip is on 1 open bnd only, isbnd(1,ip) points to the global segment # of that open bnd and isbnd(2,ip)=0 ; if ip is on 2 open bnds, isbnd(1:2,ip) point to the global segment #s for the 2 open bnds. If ip is on land bnd only (i.e., not on open bnd), isbnd(1,ip)= 1 and isbnd(2,ip)=0 . If ip is an internal node, isbnd(1:2,ip)=0 . Therefore, ip is on open bnd if isbnd(1,ip)>0 (and in this case isbnd(2,ip) may also be positive, even though isbnd(2,ip) may be outside the aug. domain), on land bnd (not on any open bnd) if isbnd(1,ip)= 1 , and an internal node if isbnd(1,ip)=0 . If on open bnd, isbnd(-2:-1,ip) are global index (i.e., isbnd(-1,ip) th node on the isbnd(1,ip) th open bnd); isbs(nsa) - positive if a local side is on the global open bnd (in this case, isbs() is the global segment #); 1 if it is on land bnd; 0 if internal side. iettype , ifltype , itetype , and isatype all take global bnd segment as argument; other b.c. arrays ( eth etc) are also global. uth(nvrt,nsa) , vth(nvrt,nsa) \u2013 local b.c. for ifltype/=0 for a local side. uthnd(nvrt,mnond_global, nope_global) , vthnd() \u2013 global arrays. elbc(ip) \u2013 ip is a local node. Arrays defined in elfe_msgp.F90 nnbr - # of neighbor processors (excluding myrank ). nbrrank(nnbr) \u2013 rank of each neighbor processor. int :: ranknbr(0:nproc-1) \u2013 neighbor # for each processor (0 if not neighbor). nerecv(nnbr) - # of elements to be received from each neighbor. ierecv(1: nerecv(nnbr),nnbr) \u2013 list of element indices (ghost in myrank ) to be received from each neighbor (where the elements are resident and not ghost). nesend(nnbr) - # of elements to be sent to each neighbor. iesend(1: nesend(nnbr),nnbr) \u2013 list of element indices (local resident in myrank ) to be sent to each neighbor (where the elements are ghost). Similar for nodes/side ( nprecv , iprecv etc). A note on ghost exchange Since the message exchanges between processors have to wait for each other in order to communicate collectively, it's not necessary to synchronize the processes.

Output: ! newtype - new datatype (handle) Note The new MPI type treats multi-dimensional arrays in FORTRAN as 1D array, expanding with 1st index varying before 2nd etc. So this routine can be used to grab discontiguous data blocks from multi- dimensional arrays. So if a 2D array is a(nvrt,nea) the corresponding 1D array is illustrated below: \\[\\begin{equation*} nea \\stackrel{nvrt}{ \\begin{bmatrix} (1, 1) & (2, 1) & \\cdots & (nvrt, 1)\\\\ (1, 2) & (2, 2) & \\cdots & (nvrt, 2)\\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots\\\\ (1, nea) & (2, nea) & \\cdots & (nvrt, nea) \\end{bmatrix} } \\end{equation*}\\] Now suppose we need to grab all ghost elements iesend(1:nesend), these will correspond to rows iesend(i) of the table. In this case the # of blocks is nesend, block length is nvrt, and displacement of ith block is (iesend(i)-1)*nvrt. MPI_Barrier : Blocks until all process have reached this routine. int MPI_Barrier ( MPI_Comm comm ) !

Outputs ! recvbuf - address of receive buffer (choice) I/O channels in SCHISM \u00b6 You need to exercise caution when dealing with parallel I/O especially for writing. For writing outputs, you\u2019d generally let only 1 process do the job, e.g. if ( myrank == 0 ) write ( 10 , * ) If you do need to have all processes write e.g. debug messages, you\u2019d consider using channel 12 which has been pre-set to point to multiple files from each MPI process (see below). Here are all I/O channel numbers currently used in different sub-models of SCHISM (and so you\u2019d avoid using them). A good way to find out if a channel is available is to issue the following cmd from src/ - grep \"(61\" */*.F90 # Looks for '(61' Please contact lead developer after you have selected a channel number to use in your module. Hydro/ : Channels between 8 and 200 are used by various codes for I/O. In particular - 101 to 100+noutputs (inclusive of both): reserved for global outputs (including from tracers like sediment, EcoSim, ICM, as well as WWM); 201-250: non-standard outputs (e.g. at sidecenters, prism centers); 251 to 259: reserved for station outputs; 16: this channel points to mirror.out (on rank 0), the main message output about the run. You should use it with if(myrank==0) . WWM 1100 to 1200: handles for inputs/outputs etc EcoSim 600: outputting some messages ICM 301 to 323: reading channels for non-point source inputs for ICM Sediment (SED and SED2D) 26, 2626 Following are some generic channels - 10, 31, 32 : used for one-off I/O \u2013 can be used by other sub-models as long as you close them immediately after use; 12 : this channel is initialized by different processes to point to files outputs/nonfatal_xxxx , where \u201cxxxx\u201d are the process IDs. Therefore it\u2019s very useful for debugging purpose; you can use it anywhere in your part of the code to dump messages to these files. Example code \u00b6 If you are working on the code you may be confused about the exchanges inside SCHISM. When should you use these? The first thing you need to remember when writing MPI code with domain decomposition is that a rank (or MPI 'process') only has info in its 'augmented' (=resident + ghost) domain, and knows absolutely nothing outside this region. Domain decomposition for code example. Consider Figure 4 . For example, you want to do averaging at each node of the sub-domain around its ball of elements. do i = 1 , np !not 'npa' sum1 = 0 sum_a = 0 do j = 1 , nne ( i ) ie = indel ( j , i ) sum1 = sum1 + stokes ( ie ) * area ( ie ) sum_a = sum_a + area ( ie ) enddo !j stokes_nd ( i ) = sum1 / sum_a enddo !i call exchange_p2d ( stokes_nd ) Notice that you'd use np instead of npa ( =np+npg ; augmented domain) here. For any resident node P , indel() is well defined (because again, Rank 1 has info in its augmented domain including the ghost zone), and so the loops make sense. As long as all ranks have same info in each others' ghost zones (which is the purpose of exchange routines), stokes_nd at an interface node (e.g. P ) will be same across ranks. However, for a ghost node Q , some surrounding elements are located outside the augmented domain (and in this case, indel() are actually negative!), and so if you use the same operation, erroneous values at ghost nodes would be generated. Therefore you cannot use npa in the outer loop. Now, after this loop is executed, what happens to the ghost nodes like Q ? Since they are excluded on Rank 1, the stokes_nd will be wrong there. Fortunately, some neighboring ranks have the correct values for these nodes, which are resident nodes in those neighboring ranks; e.g., Q is a resident node of Rank 0. So now different ranks will have different values at some overlapping nodes, and this needs to be avoided. In order to make sure each rank has correct (and up-to-date) values in its augmented domain, you need to follow this loop with an exchange routine. Remember that for the exchange routines to work, you need to define the exchanged array in the augmented domain - allocate ( stokes_nd ( npa )) !not 'np' in order to allow each rank to receive info in the ghost zone. Description of all exchange routines used in SCHISM can be found in schism_msgp.F90 . The above is just one example of when exchanges are needed. Usually this involves some kind of queries into a neighborhood, but beware that there are other circumstances where exchanges are necessary. The most important thing to remember A rank only has info in its 'augmented' domain, and knows absolutely nothing outside this region. In MPI code, it's crucial to make sure all ranks have identical values in overlapping zone. Now let's consider an example where no exchanges are needed. Say you want to simply go through all elements and update some arrays defined at elements: do i = 1 , nea !not 'ne' qdl_e ( i ) = cde ( i ) * dte / area ( i ) enddo !i Since all ranks have info of cde and area locally available, qdl_e will be correctly calculated even inside the ghost zones, and its values are the same cross ranks there (since cde and area are same cross ranks in the overlapping zones). So in this case you'd use nea instead of ne in the loop. Of course, there is nothing wrong with using ne in the loop followed by an exchange routine, but doing so would be less efficient and incur unnecessary communication cost. General code guide \u00b6 Here are some house rules for preparing your own code - No spaces between # (pre-processor) and if/else/end for CPP flag; Try to use the I/O channel number directly, e.g., read(61, etc) instead of assigning a number to a variable (e.g. read(ich,) . This'd facilitate others searching for conflicts; Avoid using tabs in editor as they mess up with the appearance. Use space instead and strictly align code blocks for easy read. Do not use automatic arrays of \u22652 dimensions. It\u2019s often tempting to grab dimensions directly from the module schism_glbl and use them to define arrays in a routine; e.g. vel_sd(nvrt,nsa) . This causes trouble with some compilers and may result in segfault. Use either of the following 2 approaches instead: allocatable arrays (and always remember to deallocate them at the end of the routine); pass on the dimensions explicitly as dummy arguments (e.g. subroutine routine1(nvrt2,nsa2, vel_sd..) , where nvrt2=nvrt and nsa2=nsa , and then use these to define: vel_sd (nvrt2,nsa2) ).","title":"Code structure"},{"location":"code-contribution.html#general-info","text":"SCHISM was written in MPI FORTRAN 90.

When should you use these? The first thing you need to remember when writing MPI code with domain decomposition is that a rank (or MPI 'process') only has info in its 'augmented' (=resident + ghost) domain, and knows absolutely nothing outside this region. Domain decomposition for code example. Consider Figure 4 . For example, you want to do averaging at each node of the sub-domain around its ball of elements. do i = 1 , np !not 'npa' sum1 = 0 sum_a = 0 do j = 1 , nne ( i ) ie = indel ( j , i ) sum1 = sum1 + stokes ( ie ) * area ( ie ) sum_a = sum_a + area ( ie ) enddo !j stokes_nd ( i ) = sum1 / sum_a enddo !i call exchange_p2d ( stokes_nd ) Notice that you'd use np instead of npa ( =np+npg ; augmented domain) here. For any resident node P , indel() is well defined (because again, Rank 1 has info in its augmented domain including the ghost zone), and so the loops make sense. As long as all ranks have same info in each others' ghost zones (which is the purpose of exchange routines), stokes_nd at an interface node (e.g. P ) will be same across ranks. However, for a ghost node Q , some surrounding elements are located outside the augmented domain (and in this case, indel() are actually negative!), and so if you use the same operation, erroneous values at ghost nodes would be generated. Therefore you cannot use npa in the outer loop. Now, after this loop is executed, what happens to the ghost nodes like Q ? Since they are excluded on Rank 1, the stokes_nd will be wrong there. Fortunately, some neighboring ranks have the correct values for these nodes, which are resident nodes in those neighboring ranks; e.g., Q is a resident node of Rank 0. So now different ranks will have different values at some overlapping nodes, and this needs to be avoided. In order to make sure each rank has correct (and up-to-date) values in its augmented domain, you need to follow this loop with an exchange routine. Remember that for the exchange routines to work, you need to define the exchanged array in the augmented domain - allocate ( stokes_nd ( npa )) !not 'np' in order to allow each rank to receive info in the ghost zone. Description of all exchange routines used in SCHISM can be found in schism_msgp.F90 . The above is just one example of when exchanges are needed. Usually this involves some kind of queries into a neighborhood, but beware that there are other circumstances where exchanges are necessary. The most important thing to remember A rank only has info in its 'augmented' domain, and knows absolutely nothing outside this region. In MPI code, it's crucial to make sure all ranks have identical values in overlapping zone. Now let's consider an example where no exchanges are needed. Say you want to simply go through all elements and update some arrays defined at elements: do i = 1 , nea !not 'ne' qdl_e ( i ) = cde ( i ) * dte / area ( i ) enddo !i Since all ranks have info of cde and area locally available, qdl_e will be correctly calculated even inside the ghost zones, and its values are the same cross ranks there (since cde and area are same cross ranks in the overlapping zones). So in this case you'd use nea instead of ne in the loop. Of course, there is nothing wrong with using ne in the loop followed by an exchange routine, but doing so would be less efficient and incur unnecessary communication cost.","title":"Example code"},{"location":"code-contribution.html#general-code-guide","text":"Here are some house rules for preparing your own code - No spaces between # (pre-processor) and if/else/end for CPP flag; Try to use the I/O channel number directly, e.g., read(61, etc) instead of assigning a number to a variable (e.g. read(ich,) . This'd facilitate others searching for conflicts; Avoid using tabs in editor as they mess up with the appearance. Use space instead and strictly align code blocks for easy read. Do not use automatic arrays of \u22652 dimensions. It\u2019s often tempting to grab dimensions directly from the module schism_glbl and use them to define arrays in a routine; e.g. vel_sd(nvrt,nsa) . This causes trouble with some compilers and may result in segfault. Use either of the following 2 approaches instead: allocatable arrays (and always remember to deallocate them at the end of the routine); pass on the dimensions explicitly as dummy arguments (e.g. subroutine routine1(nvrt2,nsa2, vel_sd..) , where nvrt2=nvrt and nsa2=nsa , and then use these to define: vel_sd (nvrt2,nsa2) ).","title":"General code guide"},{"location":"contribute-to-this-online-manual.html","text":"Overview \u00b6 All SCHISM developers are encouraged to keep this online manual up to date with their code development.

Just log in, and select 'Archive' from the left of the screen, and then on right side of screen select 'Advanced search'. My results show platform/compiler/CPU dependency Due to some intricate differences between different compilers/platforms some minor differences in results are expected. Bit-by-bit match of results using different numbers of CPUs is impossible also. But the differences should be small and should stabilize over time iteration. Run crashed with a fatal.error error message \"QUICKSEARCH: no intersecting edge....\" First you need to viz the results before the crash (e.g. surface velocity) to see if anything is outrageously wrong. Often times, errors such as this, related to the backtracking, come from other errors (e.g. NaN in inputs). Very rarely, the error originates from the underflow issue in the backtracking/ELM (and the results otherwise look reasonable). In the backtracking step, the code assumes that the path intersects sides of elements at 1 unique point that does not coincide with any node (cf. Fig. 1 ). Obviously this causes problem especially in some academic cases (e.g. the velocity aligns perfectly with grid line). To avoid this issue, the code nudges the starting position of backtracking (with parameter btrack_nudge ) toward the starting element's centroid. Occasionally, this is still insufficient when the velocity is large on very fine meshes. One way out of this is to reduce dtb_max and dtb_min to get more accurate trajectory. Run crashed with a fatal.error error message \"bktrk_subs: overflow...\" or \"MAIN: nbtrk > mxnbt\" The backtracking (ELM) in SCHISM is parallelized across MPI processes, and some arrays need to be allocated to store trajectories that exited the augmented domain. The dimension of those arrays is defined in mxnbt and mnbt, which are proportional to local # of side and # of levels, and the proportionality constants are defined in param.nml: s1_mxnbt = 0.5 , s2_mxnbt = 3.5 (Gradually) increasing these (to say 1, and 4) will solve the problem. Note that these constants only affect memory consumption and not accuracy. How to do a tidal simulation with SCHISM? The simplest way is to use SCHISM 2D. If you have to use SCHISM 3D, make sure the vertical grid is reasonable. My run crashed; how can I find out why? The best way to find out the reason for a crash is to visualize the surface velocity with VisIT. Usually you may see some large/noisy velocity somewhere, which may give you some hints on grid or forcing issues etc. Sometimes you want to visualize the problem right before the crash. You cannot use autocombine_MPI_elfe.pl as the last stack of output is incomplete. But you can use the FORTRAN combine script (e.g., combine_output* ) to directly combine an incomplete stack. Just follow the instruction in the header of this script to prepare the inputs and run. Then visualize the combined outputs. How to impose river discharge if the depth is negative there? See Grid generation . Run crashes with a dry boundary/depth error. SCHISM allows dry open-boundary nodes, but the entire open boundary segment cannot be dry at any given time if the velocity B.C. is imposed there. Either relocate the boundary or deepen some nodes to allow flow to come in. See Grid generation . I have large velocity at open boundary In hydrostatic models, the incoming velocity should be specified at open boundary. Over-specification i.e. elevation+velocity B.C. there usually avoids the problem, but the two B.C.\u2019s must be largely consistent with each other. The velocity B.C. can be generated using global circulation model (HYCOM etc) plus global tidal model (FES etc). fatal.error indicates \u201cCould not find suitable element in input\u201d This is likely because your sflux*.nc is not prepared properly: either the grid in .nc does not cover hgrid.ll , or the structured grid in .nc is not ordered counter-clockwise.","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"known_issues.html","text":"Freshwater injection stuck near injection place \u00b6 This can happen with the combined use of (1) point source/sink ( if_source =1); (2) LSC2 with 1-2 layers near injection places; (3) baroclinic model. The main symptom is that the freshwater seemingly gets stuck near the injection points and does not flow out as expected. The reason is that insufficient number of vertical layers cannot properly set up an exchange flow (that requires stratification), and as a result, the fresh/salt water interface oscillates instead of tilting as expects. Some work-arounds are: Change to open boundary condition approach Better salinity initial condition. If the salt intrusion should never reach the injection place, create a freswater zone near the injection in the I.C. Use more vertical layers near injection (one way to do this is to deepen the local depths to allow more layers) Nudge (inu_SAL=1 or 2) strongly in a region near injection Numerical dispersion with WENO \u00b6 The 3rd-order WENO scheme has numerical dispersion that needs to be controlled, usually by adjusting epsilon[12] in param.nml . This approach usually works well. Under some circumstances, e.g. watershed in the compound flooding cases, this adjustment is not enough, especially if hybrization with ELM transport is used ( ielm_transport=1 ). This is because ELM tracer results may introduce 'shocks' to the local WENO stencil, which in turn generate disperision. In those cases, the users need to adjust tvd.prop to make some areas upwind as well to ensure monotonicity, because upwind scheme handles shocks well. Figure 1 shows the result of disperion symptom from WENO, in the form of high salinity in some upriver regions of Chesapeake Bay. Higher-order WENO, 1st-order upwind and ELM solvers are applied in adjacent elements in close proximity in those upriver regions (note that h_tvd =5m in this case). Making those upriver elements upwind via tvd.prop resolves this issue; cf. Fig. 2 . Numerical dispersion in WENO led to high surface salinity in Chesapeake Bay (circled area).

Such applications may include a few or dozens of components representing atmospheric, oceanic, terrestrial, or other physical domains, and their constituent processes (dynamical, chemical, biological, etc.). Often these components are developed by different groups independently, and must be \u201ccoupled\u201d together using software that transfers and transforms data among the components in order to form functional simulations. SCHISM can be such a model component within an ESMF-coupled system. A so-called \"cap\" wraps SCHISM and exposes it via the ESMF Application Programming Interface (API). The interfaces exposed through the API are (1) import of fields, (2) export of fields, and (3) control structure. Obtaining and building the cap \u00b6 The ESMF and the NUOPC caps are jointly hosted in a separate repository on https://github.com/schism-dev/schism-esmf .

Here lies the greatest strength and challenges of using an UG model like SCHISM. Fortunately the meshgen tools have come a long way since 2000s and at the moment we are routinely generating large UGs with millions of nodes and ever higher resolution, all within a few hours (after the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) has been assembled). Note We will only cover SCHISM specific aspects of gridgen using SMS in this chapter; you are referred to schism.wiki for other info related to DEM preparation etc. Please also refer to Dr. Wood\u2019s thesis for some insight info on using SMS. Important One important point to remember is that mesh generation for SCHISM always starts from raw high-quality DEMs; do NOT use computational grids from another model as DEM because most hydrodynamic models smooth the bathymetry. With some practice and care, you can generate complex UG like Figure 1 . A few important things to note before we dive into details of mesh generation. SCHISM is an implicit model It can tolerate bad mesh quality (at least it won\u2019t blow up easily) High resolution is and should be used to faithfully capture the main features of DEMs Since we do not smooth or manipulate bathymetry in the model mesh, the model results are sensitive/responsive to DEM quality. Therefore, make sure the DEM quality is sufficiently good. Establish your workflow starting from mesh generation to model setup so you can easily repeat/iterate. San Francisco Bay & Delta grid (c/o CAL-Department of Water Resource (DWR)). Beware of CFL number \u00b6 You may be familiar with the CFL restriction associated with explicit (mode-splitting) models \\(\\text{CFL} \\lt 1\\) , where the CFL number is defined as - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq01} \\text{CFL} = \\frac{\\left( \\left| \\pmb{u} \\right| + \\sqrt{gh} \\right) \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(h\\) is the local water depth, and \\(\\pmb{u}\\) is the flow velocity. Note that the surface wave celerity term is undefined when \\(h \\lt 0\\) , and in the shallow area it\u2019s best to drop this term and assume \\(\\left| \\pmb{u} \\right| \\sim 1\\) , and therefore \\(\\text{CFL} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\) when \\(h \\lt 0.1\\) m. Being an implicit model using ELM, SCHISM has a somewhat opposite requirement: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq02} \\text{CFL} \\gt 0.4 \\end{equation}\\] You may be able to get away with \\(\\text{CFL}\\gt 0.2\\) in some applications like tsunami. Therefore care must be taken in the mesh generation process; otherwise numerical diffusion in ELM would ruin your results, which may manifest itself in the form of either noise or dissipation. For a given mesh, the errors changes with \\(\\Delta t\\) in a nonlinear manner, as shown in Figure 2 . Operational range for time step for a given mesh size. The meshgen process for SCHISM therefore starts with a range of time step for your application, We found the following ranges work for field applications: 100-400s step for barotropic applications, and 100-200s for baroclinic applications. Eqn. \\(\\ref{eq02}\\) is then used to calculate the \\(coarsest\\) mesh size at each depth (in anticipation of the smallest possible \\(\\Delta t = 100s\\) ). Table 1 shows some examples. You can see that the inverse CFL restriction is not restrictive. Table 1. Coarsest mesh resolution at sample depths, assuming a \u2018worse case\u2019 scenario of \\(\\Delta t=100s\\) . h(m) \\(\\Delta x_{max}\\) (m) 1 790 10 2500 50 5.5e3 100 7.9e3 500 1.7e4 1000 2.5e4 4000 5e4 Three immediate consequences of Eqs. \\(\\ref{eq02}\\) are that - you do not need to reduce \\(\\Delta t\\) if you refine mesh (yay!) if you have to coarsen mesh, you will have to recheck Eq. \\(\\ref{eq02}\\) if you have to reduce the time step for some reason, you may have to refine mesh The first consequence embodies the greatest strength (efficiency) of SCHISM as an implicit model. (However, if you are doing a convergence study, you need to keep the \\(\\text{CFL}\\) number fixed while reducing the time step (which means you have to reduce the mesh spacing), as is done with explicit models.) Therefore both explicit and implicit models converge (and are consistent) as \\(\\Delta x, \\Delta t \\rightarrow 0\\) and \\(\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t} = \\text{constant}\\) . Check CFL number in xmgredit5 With xmgredit5, you can very easily visualize CFL for the entire grid. xmgredit5 -belel -1.e-10 hgrid.gr3 . -belel -1.e-10 is used mainly to increase precision for lat/lon grid. if your hgrid.gr3 is in lat/lon, you need to first project it, as the grid size dx in lat/lon is not in meters) Since the CFL inside ACE is calculated without \\(\\pmb{u}\\) , and a different form is used for CFL in the shallow \\(h \\lt 0.1m\\) , we should impose a min depth of 0.1m, so that \\(\\sqrt{gh} = 1m/s\\) . You can do this by - Edit \\(\\rightarrow\\) Edit over grid/regions \\(\\rightarrow\\) Evaluate. In the dialogue box, type depth=max(depth,0.1) The Evaluate function is also very useful for generation of other .gr3 files needed by SCHISM Special \\(\\rightarrow\\) Dimensionless numbers. In the right half of the dialogue box, type in 100s ( \\(\\Delta t\\) ), Warning value (say 0.8), Unacceptable value (say 0.4), press Display filled. The color will appear in the main window, with red indicating good CFL, and green for bad CFL, and orange somewhere in between. You may also 'Display Courant number' but this may take a while to refresh, and so you may want to zoom into a small region first. Small patches of \u2018green\u2019 are OK with SCHISM, especially if they are in shallow area. However, avoid large patches of green in deeper area. Revise your grid accordingly if necessary. Tsunami simulations In tsunami simulations, \\(\\Delta t\\) has to be small (~1s) due to small wavelength, and you can bypass the CFL condition by turning off advection in deeper depths as the advection is negligible there. You also need to make sure that each wavelength is resolved by at least 20 grid points. Mesh quality \u00b6 SCHISM\u2019s superior stability means the model is very forgiving in mesh quality; skewness of triangles (defined as the ratio between the max. side and the equivalent radius) >15 can be used without problem (the skewness can be easily checked with xmgredit5: Evaluate \\(\\rightarrow\\) Acceptable skewness). However, for baroclinic applications, mesh quality may be important in critical regions. Also note that quality quads are required; always use the pre-processing script fix_bad_quads.f90 to split bad quads. (You can check quad quality in xmgredit5 \\(\\rightarrow\\) Edit \\(\\rightarrow\\) Edit over region \\(\\rightarrow\\) Quality check for quadrangles, and input 0.5 (which is the ratio between the min and max interior angles) for cutoff and \u2018Accept\u2019. All violating elements will be highlighted.) Unlike explicit models, you\u2019ll find meshgen for SCHISM is more \u2018intuitive\u2019 and \u2018freer\u2019. Implicit model allows you to focus on physics instead of numerics. You are freer to resolve important features (e.g. jetties) without worrying about cost/instability. SCHISM is not picky about mesh quality (except for quads). While the physics generally suggests that coarser resolution be used in deeper depths, this is not always the best practice. E.g., you should resolve the channel to more accurately represent the salt intrusion process. Barotropic simulation Mesh quality requirement is relatively lax for barotropic simulations. Besides the considerations above, you mainly need to use appropriate resolution based on physics (e.g., generally coarser resolution in deeper depths and finer resolution for shallow depths but make sure channels are resolved/unblocked). Most important task is to accurately capture the water volume for tide propagation. Remember: you are on implicit UG territory, and so you are free to resolve features as you wish! Baroclinic simulation The transport process is influenced by your choice of mesh, and so the meshgen for baroclinic simulations needs some attention. The mesh quality may need to be better in some critical areas (otherwise you may see noise). Quasi-uniform grid needs to be used in the eddying regime, not for stability but to avoid distortion of eddies (Zhang et al. 2016); gradual transition in resolution should be used as much as possible for eddying regime. Avoiding excessive resolution in high-flow area would speed up the transport TVD solver. Mesh generation process for baroclinic applications requires more effort and is often an iterative process, and so it\u2019s important to establish a good work flow from the start. In a later chapter we will cover some advanced topics on meshing eddying and transitional regimes. Conceptual maps in SMS While there are many methods for creating conceptual maps in SMS, we typically extract representative isobaths (e.g., isobath at the highest gradient that represents slope) first as shapefiles using e.g. GIS tools, and then import the shapefiles into SMS as feature arcs, and specify resolution along each arc based on Table 1 . An exmample map is given below. The key is to faithfully capture the main features of DEMs. There are two main types of meshing options in SMS: paving (triangles) and patch (quads) that can be effetively utilized for our purpose. SMS map in a stretch of San Francisco Bay. Channels, channels, channels \u00b6 Channels serve as the main conduit for fresh and ocean water flow, and thus are very important features for gravitational circulation. When meshing channels, try to use \u2018patch\u2019 method to generate quads as much as possible for better efficiency and precise control on cross-channel resolution (and do not round corners (Figure 3 )). Use arcs to follow the thalweg and the steep slopes (highest gradient zone for isobaths). Avoid artificial blocking of channels (Figure 4 ), which may lead to noisy flow field, but try to represent the channel cross section as faithfully as possible to capture the water volume. There is no need for bathymetry smoothing or other manipulation (and implicitness allows high resolution on steep slope and skew elements). A good mesh together with SCHISM\u2019s flexible vertical gridding system \\(LSC^2\\) one can accurately capture the 3D processes. Side view of channel representation. Remember SCHISM does not allow partial wet/dry. Patch method It is well known that channelized flow is better simulated using flow-aligned quads. Therefore we recommend using patch in SMS to mesh channels. This approach allows precise control on the cross-channel resolution which is important for 3D processes. Paving, on the other hand, can lead to either excessively large mesh size or inadequate cross-channel resolution. Meshing near wetting and drying \u00b6 You may want to have an arc follow the initial shoreline (but there is no need to be exactly following the shoreline). Reasonable mesh transition should be done from shoreline to dryland. Use comparable or finer mesh resolution in the dryland that is expected to be wetted, and then transition to coarser resolution beyond (to account for rare inundation). Simulating wetting and drying well with SCHISM requires some care. A critical parameter in shallow area is the bottom friction. Note that the bottom friction parameterizations are very different between 2D and 3D prisms. From a physical point of view, the 2D and 3D models behave very differently. Consider a straight channel with variable depths, with flow coming from deeper part and going into shallower part. Figure 5 shows the side views of 2D and 3D velocities. Side view of channel flow for (a) 2D and (b) 3D cases. Volume conservation dictates larger velocities in shallow areas. Note that strong shear is possible in 3D model. In 2D model, the velocity is depth-averaged and vertical shear is not represented. Strong friction directly translates into reduced velocity. In 3D model however, a large bottom friction will lead to strong shear, although the depth integrated velocity value matches that from the 2D model. This problem is exacerbated by the exaggeration of \\(C_d\\) in the shallow if the roughness formula is used (since the bottom cell thickness is very small). A classical pathological velocity field obtained with SCHISM is seen in Figure 6 . Noisy velocity field in shallow areas in SCHISM 3D. There are a few approaches to resolve this issue. First, make sure the channel is not blocked. Second, try to use 2D prisms in shallows (so you can use large friction) with SCHISM \\(LSC^2\\) system. Using a larger thetai would also stabilize the wetting and drying fronts. As a last resort if you have to use 3D configuration in shallows, reduce friction (or even set it to 0). Dredging open boundary A very common crash is related to the wet/dry near the open boundary. SCHISM does NOT allow an entire open boundary segment to become dry at ANY time (while drying at individual nodes is fine). Therefore you need to make sure the depths there are deep enough compared to expected tidal range. An easy way is to impose a minimum depth near those segments (which can be done using xmgredit5) if the accuracy near the boundary is not of importance. Since the wet/dry rule inside SCHISM is element-based, a node becomes dry if all of its surrounding elements become dry. As a result, you may need to impose a minimum depth a couple of rows of elements into the domain, not just at open boundary nodes. This ensures that water can come into the domain without being blocked at the open boundary. Note that wet/dry is allowed to occur at land/island boundaries or interior nodes. Alternative options If you care about wetting and drying near the open boundary location, one option is to relocate the open boundary elsewhere. Also for upstream rivers where depths become negative and you do not want to dredge depths there, you can use the bed deformation option ( imm=1 ): start with a dredged boundary, and then gradually move the bed back to its original location. The most robust option, however, is to use point sources ( if_source=1 ): in this case no open boundary is required there so wet/dry can happen without crashing the code. However, the open boundary approach is usually more accurate. Periodic boundary condition \u00b6 Implementing this type of B.C. in SCHISM introduces some challenges in the barotropic solver because it\u2019d destroy the symmetry of the matrix and cause blowup if the conditioning is sufficiently bad. A workaround is to \u2018drape\u2019 the hgrid onto a sphere to avoid the corresponding open boundary segments altogether. A simple script to guide this process can be found in Utility/Pre-Processing/periodic_grid.f90 .

For a given mesh, the errors changes with \\(\\Delta t\\) in a nonlinear manner, as shown in Figure 2 . Operational range for time step for a given mesh size. The meshgen process for SCHISM therefore starts with a range of time step for your application, We found the following ranges work for field applications: 100-400s step for barotropic applications, and 100-200s for baroclinic applications. Eqn. \\(\\ref{eq02}\\) is then used to calculate the \\(coarsest\\) mesh size at each depth (in anticipation of the smallest possible \\(\\Delta t = 100s\\) ). Table 1 shows some examples.

(However, if you are doing a convergence study, you need to keep the \\(\\text{CFL}\\) number fixed while reducing the time step (which means you have to reduce the mesh spacing), as is done with explicit models.) Therefore both explicit and implicit models converge (and are consistent) as \\(\\Delta x, \\Delta t \\rightarrow 0\\) and \\(\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t} = \\text{constant}\\) . Check CFL number in xmgredit5 With xmgredit5, you can very easily visualize CFL for the entire grid. xmgredit5 -belel -1.e-10 hgrid.gr3 . -belel -1.e-10 is used mainly to increase precision for lat/lon grid. if your hgrid.gr3 is in lat/lon, you need to first project it, as the grid size dx in lat/lon is not in meters) Since the CFL inside ACE is calculated without \\(\\pmb{u}\\) , and a different form is used for CFL in the shallow \\(h \\lt 0.1m\\) , we should impose a min depth of 0.1m, so that \\(\\sqrt{gh} = 1m/s\\) . You can do this by - Edit \\(\\rightarrow\\) Edit over grid/regions \\(\\rightarrow\\) Evaluate.

You may also 'Display Courant number' but this may take a while to refresh, and so you may want to zoom into a small region first. Small patches of \u2018green\u2019 are OK with SCHISM, especially if they are in shallow area. However, avoid large patches of green in deeper area. Revise your grid accordingly if necessary. Tsunami simulations In tsunami simulations, \\(\\Delta t\\) has to be small (~1s) due to small wavelength, and you can bypass the CFL condition by turning off advection in deeper depths as the advection is negligible there. You also need to make sure that each wavelength is resolved by at least 20 grid points.","title":"Beware of CFL number"},{"location":"getting-started/grid-generation.html#mesh-quality","text":"SCHISM\u2019s superior stability means the model is very forgiving in mesh quality; skewness of triangles (defined as the ratio between the max. side and the equivalent radius) >15 can be used without problem (the skewness can be easily checked with xmgredit5: Evaluate \\(\\rightarrow\\) Acceptable skewness).

Implicit model allows you to focus on physics instead of numerics. You are freer to resolve important features (e.g. jetties) without worrying about cost/instability. SCHISM is not picky about mesh quality (except for quads). While the physics generally suggests that coarser resolution be used in deeper depths, this is not always the best practice. E.g., you should resolve the channel to more accurately represent the salt intrusion process. Barotropic simulation Mesh quality requirement is relatively lax for barotropic simulations. Besides the considerations above, you mainly need to use appropriate resolution based on physics (e.g., generally coarser resolution in deeper depths and finer resolution for shallow depths but make sure channels are resolved/unblocked). Most important task is to accurately capture the water volume for tide propagation. Remember: you are on implicit UG territory, and so you are free to resolve features as you wish! Baroclinic simulation The transport process is influenced by your choice of mesh, and so the meshgen for baroclinic simulations needs some attention. The mesh quality may need to be better in some critical areas (otherwise you may see noise). Quasi-uniform grid needs to be used in the eddying regime, not for stability but to avoid distortion of eddies (Zhang et al. 2016); gradual transition in resolution should be used as much as possible for eddying regime. Avoiding excessive resolution in high-flow area would speed up the transport TVD solver. Mesh generation process for baroclinic applications requires more effort and is often an iterative process, and so it\u2019s important to establish a good work flow from the start. In a later chapter we will cover some advanced topics on meshing eddying and transitional regimes. Conceptual maps in SMS While there are many methods for creating conceptual maps in SMS, we typically extract representative isobaths (e.g., isobath at the highest gradient that represents slope) first as shapefiles using e.g. GIS tools, and then import the shapefiles into SMS as feature arcs, and specify resolution along each arc based on Table 1 . An exmample map is given below. The key is to faithfully capture the main features of DEMs. There are two main types of meshing options in SMS: paving (triangles) and patch (quads) that can be effetively utilized for our purpose. SMS map in a stretch of San Francisco Bay.","title":"Mesh quality"},{"location":"getting-started/grid-generation.html#channels-channels-channels","text":"Channels serve as the main conduit for fresh and ocean water flow, and thus are very important features for gravitational circulation. When meshing channels, try to use \u2018patch\u2019 method to generate quads as much as possible for better efficiency and precise control on cross-channel resolution (and do not round corners (Figure 3 )). Use arcs to follow the thalweg and the steep slopes (highest gradient zone for isobaths). Avoid artificial blocking of channels (Figure 4 ), which may lead to noisy flow field, but try to represent the channel cross section as faithfully as possible to capture the water volume. There is no need for bathymetry smoothing or other manipulation (and implicitness allows high resolution on steep slope and skew elements).

Remember SCHISM does not allow partial wet/dry. Patch method It is well known that channelized flow is better simulated using flow-aligned quads. Therefore we recommend using patch in SMS to mesh channels. This approach allows precise control on the cross-channel resolution which is important for 3D processes. Paving, on the other hand, can lead to either excessively large mesh size or inadequate cross-channel resolution.","title":"Channels, channels, channels"},{"location":"getting-started/grid-generation.html#meshing-near-wetting-and-drying","text":"You may want to have an arc follow the initial shoreline (but there is no need to be exactly following the shoreline). Reasonable mesh transition should be done from shoreline to dryland. Use comparable or finer mesh resolution in the dryland that is expected to be wetted, and then transition to coarser resolution beyond (to account for rare inundation). Simulating wetting and drying well with SCHISM requires some care. A critical parameter in shallow area is the bottom friction. Note that the bottom friction parameterizations are very different between 2D and 3D prisms. From a physical point of view, the 2D and 3D models behave very differently. Consider a straight channel with variable depths, with flow coming from deeper part and going into shallower part. Figure 5 shows the side views of 2D and 3D velocities. Side view of channel flow for (a) 2D and (b) 3D cases. Volume conservation dictates larger velocities in shallow areas. Note that strong shear is possible in 3D model. In 2D model, the velocity is depth-averaged and vertical shear is not represented. Strong friction directly translates into reduced velocity. In 3D model however, a large bottom friction will lead to strong shear, although the depth integrated velocity value matches that from the 2D model. This problem is exacerbated by the exaggeration of \\(C_d\\) in the shallow if the roughness formula is used (since the bottom cell thickness is very small).

PySCHISM supports three types of atmpsheric datasets. Notes: startdate should be one day earlier than the actual run startdate, because there is no data at t00z. Acoordingly, add two more extra days for rnday in the following scripts. ECMWF ERA5 \u00b6 ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmoshperic, land and oceanic climate variables.

If any tracer module is invoked, you also need the corresponding B.C. part for each tracer module, and the structure is similar to temperature. !However, if the tracer module has multiple classes (which is the case for most modules; e.g., AGE, SED etc), !you need to specify the concentration constants (under `2` etc) for all classes in 1 row. In later sections !we will give examples for `.nc` inputs. end for !j: open boundary segment The following two samples provide more direct views on the structure of bctides.in. Sample 1 illustrates how to set Type 1 (Time history; uniform along bnd) and Type 2 (Constant) boundaries: Sample 2 illustrates how to set a Type 3 (tidal) boundary: Note on AGE module The number of tracers inside this module ( ntracer_age ) must be an even number, and usually you only specify the first ntracer_age/2 tracers on some open boundaries. For example, suppose ntracer_age=4 , you can set the B.C. flags as: 3 !nope 88 3 0 0 0 0 !ocean \u2013 no age tracer b.c. here .... 5 0 1 1 3 2 !Columbia River 1. !relax for T 1. !relax for S 1. 0. 0. 0. !inject age tracer #1 here 1. !relax for AGE 3 0 2 3 3 2 !Fraser River 1. !relax for T 1. !relax for S 0. 1. 0. 0. !inject age tracer #2 here 1. !relax for AGE Note bctides.in is one of the most error prone inputs for users due to its rigid formatting requirements. One useful trick to quickly find out the error location is to deliberately crash the code by placing illegal choices along this input to help isolate the errors (think of bi-section method). For example, you can intentionally set an illegal B.C. flag of 6 at a segment to see if the code crashes before or after this point.

Note Land and Ocean boundary sagment can be generated with xmgredit5 \\(\\rightarrow\\) GridDEM \\(\\rightarrow\\) Create open/land boundaries; it can also be generated with SMS; If you have no open boundary, you can create two land boundary segments that are linked to each other. Likewise, if you have no land boundary, you should create two open boundary segments that are connected to each other; Although not required, we recommend you follow the following convention when generating the boundary segments. For the exterior boundary (open+land), go in counter-clockwise direction. With xmgredit5, the island boundaries are automatically created once you have finished designating all open and land segments on the exterior boundary. At the moment xmgredit5 cannot generate open boundary segments on islands. You cna use SMS or some python tools for this; Note that this format is the same as fort.14 of ADCIRC; keep an eye on the land boundary sagment, where instead of 741 0 in the above example SMS will produce 741 10 . At the moment, the flags for land/island boundaries are not used in SCHISM system except for WWM (see below); If WWM is used, the land boundary flags (cf. bold texts above) are required, and also there must not be any open boundary segments on any island. Therefore if you use WWM, make sure the exterior land boundary flags are 0 and island boundary flags are non-zero; Since WWM can only handle triangles, the mixed grid needs to be converted to a pure triangular grid for WWM using a pre-processing script Pre-Processing/split_quads_wwm.f90 .","title":"Horizontal grid (hgrid.gr3)"},{"location":"input-output/optional-inputs.html","text":"This section explains the details of some options inputs triggered by param.nml . The list is non-exhaustive as there are many such inputs. You can also find some example in test suite . hgrid.ll \u00b6 The format is the same as hgrid.gr3, except that the B.C. part is not necessary. The x,y of each node are replaced by lon/lat coordinates. If your model is already prepared in lon-lat, then, this file can be provided by simply making a soft-link to the hgrid.gr3 file. .gr3 \u00b6 The format is the same as hgrid.gr3 , except that the B.C. part is not necessary. The only difference between .gr3 files is that the \u2018depth\u2019 means different variables. We show some examples below. Some such inputs are generated by scripts (e.g. shapiro.gr3 , SAL_nudge.gr3 ). diffmin.gr3 and diffmax.gr3 : the \u2018depth\u2019 specifies the min/max of the viscosity or diffusivity. Needed if itur=3 or 4 . Suggested value: \\(1.e-6 m^2/s\\) for diffmin and \\(1 m^2/s\\) (or larger) for diffmax. albedo.gr3 and watertype.gr3 : required if ihconsv=1 , specifying the albedo (e.g. 0.1) and water type for attenuation rate of solar radiation. E.g., '1' is Jerlov type I (clean water), '5' is Jerlov type III etc. Consult schism_step.F90 for more details. '7' has largest attenuation rate (muddy water). adv.gr3 : Required if nadv=0 . The \u2018depth\u2019 is either 0 , 1 or 2 in this case, corresponding to where the momentum advection is turned off, using backward Euler, or using 2nd-order Runge-Kutta method at a node. krvel.gr3 : Required if inter_mom=-1 . The \u2018depth\u2019 is either 0 , 1 , corresponding to kriging ELM bring turned off/on. The generalized covariance function is specified by kr_co . bdef.gr3 : Required if imm=1 .

Below is a sample flux.th (note that negative values mean inflow!) 0. -1613.005 -6186.0 !time (in sec), discharge at the 1st boundary segment that has ifltype=1 (in bctides.in), discharge at the 2nd boundary segment with ifltype=1, etc 300. -1613.05005 -6186.60156 600. -1611.37854 -6208.62549 900. -1609.39612 -6232.22314 Notes Note that the time must start from 0, and the step can be anything \u2265dt . The '1' in TEM_1.th refers to the 1 (and only) tracer class in the temperature module; In the case of wind.th (with nws=1 or 4 ), the time step specified inside must also match wtiminc in param.nml . If nws=4 , the format of wind.th is different: each line specifies the wind u,v, and atmospheric pressure (in Pa) at all nodes. In the case of msource.th (invoked with if_source=1 ), the values after time stamp are tracer values at each source element (specified in source_sink.in ), and the order of tracers is: T,S, followed by each tracer module invoked. No vertical level info is needed here as the tracers are injected at a level or all levels. If you do not have good values for some tracers, use -9999. instead and the code will inject ambient concentration values for you. See examples of vsource.th , vsink.th and msource.th in sample_inputs/ of source code bundle. .th.nc (netcdf4) \u00b6 These include elev2D.th.nc , uv3D.th.nc , TEM_3D.th.nc , SAL_3D.th.nc , and [MOD]_3D.th.nc (where MOD is the tracer module name like \u2018COS\u2019). The format can be found below (also in test suite (e.g. schism_verification_tests/Test_ICM_UB/)). Notes the time always starts from 0, and the time step can be anything \u2265dt . Note that the time stamp series in time is not needed by the code; only time_step (in sec) is needed; time_series contains the main data at all relevant nodes; \u2018nOpenBndNodes\u2019 should be total number of nodes on all open boundary segments that require this input, and the values appear in same order as in bctides.in inside \u2018time_series\u2019; nLevels specifies the vertical structure, and nComponents specifies either scalar/vector, or # of classes in the tracer module; Most netcdf4 libraries allow float and double to be interchangeable but it's better to be strict about data type. elev2D.th.nc netcdf elev2D.th { dimensions: time = UNLIMITED ; // (73 currently) nOpenBndNodes = 748 ; nLevels = 1 ; nComponents = 1 ; one = 1 ; variables: float time_series(time, nOpenBndNodes, nLevels, nComponents) ; float time_step(one) ; double time(time) ; } uv3D.th.nc netcdf uv3D.th { dimensions: nOpenBndNodes = 748 ; one = 1 ; time = UNLIMITED ; // (73 currently) nLevels = 44 ; nComponents = 2 ; variables: float time_step(one) ; double time(time) ; float time_series(time, nOpenBndNodes, nLevels, nComponents) ; } TEM_3D.th.nc netcdf TEM_3D.th { dimensions: nOpenBndNodes = 30 ; nLevels = 35 ; nComponents = 1 ; one = 1 ; time = UNLIMITED ; // (371 currently) variables: float time_step(one) ; time_step:long_name = \"time step in seconds\" ; double time(time) ; time:long_name = \"simulation time in seconds\" ; float time_series(time, nOpenBndNodes, nLevels, nComponents) ; .prop \u00b6 The element-centered inputs color each element with a \u2018property\u2019, which can be visualized with xmgredit5 (Special \\(\\rightarrow\\) properties). xmgredit5 also allows editing of this file. The format follows xmgredit5 element property format: 1 -1 !element number, element property 2 0 3 2 4 5 .... Currently there are 3 .prop files: tvd.prop : user needs to explicitly specify horizontal regions where upwind or higher-order solver (TVD or WENO) is used, based on the element property values ( 0 : upwind; 1 : TVD or WENO) in tvd.prop . partition.prop : this input is required if you use static domain decomposition (NO_PARMETIS). The element property simple specifies the MPI process that owns each element. This can be generated e.g. by METIS. fluxflag.prop The element property flags (integers from -1,0,1,\u2026) specify the 'region number' for each element. The code will only compute the flow across a side if (1) the flags at its 2 adjacent elements differ by 1, and (2) neither flag is -1 (cf. Fig. 4.2). The output flux.out is a simple ASCII file with the format: 0.001389 0.1004E-01 0.1934E-01 !time (days), flow [m3/s] from region \u20181\u2019 to \u20180\u2019, flow from region \u20182\u2019 to \u20181\u2019,\u2026 0.002778 0.8852E-02 0.2285E-01 ... Example of `fluxflag.prop` .ic \u00b6 The I.C. inputs include the initial condition for elevation or tracers ( salt.ic , temp.ic , and ts.ic ). For most generic form of I.C. (variable in space and time), use hotstart.nc . elev.ic is a .gr3 file that specifies the initial elevation at each node. Depending on the values of flag_ic(1:2) , T,S I.C. inputs have different format. If flag_ic(1:2)= 1 , salt.ic and temp.ic take the .gr3 format; If flag_ic(1:2)= 2 , ts.ic takes the following simple format: 43 !total # of vertical levels 1 -2000. 4. 34. !level #, z-coordinates, temperature, salinity 2 -1000. 5. 34. ... Notes on ts.ic The code will extrapolate above surface or below bottom for you if your z-coordinates do not cover the full depth. Since it uses cubic spline interpolate, make sure your vertical profiles are well resolved to avoid unexpected min/max due to the cubic spline method. Similar format is used for other tracers; e.g., ICM_vvar_[1,2..].ic has a similar format to ts.ic . .nc \u00b6 Beside the time series inputs, we have the other types of netcdf4 input files as follows. Some sample files can be found in the test suite (e.g. schism_verification_tests/Test_ICM_UB/). hotstart.nc This input basically contains all major state variables defined at node/side/element. source.nc Required if if_source=-1 , this input combines all info needed for source/sink. source.nc netcdf source { dimensions: nsources = 1268 ; nsinks = UNLIMITED ; // (0 currently) ntracers = 23 ; time_msource = 732 ; time_vsource = 732 ; time_vsink = UNLIMITED ; // (0 currently) one = 1 ; variables: int source_elem(nsources) ; float vsource(time_vsource, nsources) ; float msource(time_msource, ntracers, nsources) ; double time_msource(time_msource) ; double time_vsource(time_vsource) ; float time_step_vsource(one) ; float time_step_msource(one) ; float time_step_vsink(one) ; // global attributes: :file_format = \"NETCDF4\" ; :_NCProperties = \"version=2,netcdf=4.8.1,hdf5=1.12.1\" ; } Notes Numbers of records for sources and sinks can be different; source_elem and sink_elem specify the element indices for source/sinks; The time stamps in time_msource etc are not needed by the code; only time_step_* (in sec) are required; ntracers specifies the total # of classes in all tracer modules (including T,S,..). The example above used ICM module (which has 21 classes), so together with T,S there are 23 'tracers'. *_nu.nc This input is used for tracer nudging ( inu_tr=2 ). You only need to specify values in the nudging zone and may use junk values -9999 inside (in this case the code will not nudge to the junk value). The mapping array \u2018map_to_global_node\u2019 is used to map the array indices to the global node indices. ICM_nu.nc netcdf ICM_nu { dimensions: node = 27023 ; nLevels = 40 ; ntracers = 21 ; time = UNLIMITED ; // (367 currently) variables: float time(time) ; int map_to_global_node(node) ; float tracer_concentration(time, node, nLevels, ntracers) ; } Notes node specifies total # of nodes in the nudging zone (i.e. with non-zero depths in *_nudge.gr3 ); ntracers is the # of tracer classes in this module (1 for T,S); map_to_global_node maps the local node indices to global nodes; The time stamps in time are not needed by the code, as step_inu_tr already specified the time step in nudging inputs. tracer_concentration specifies the tarcer concentrations to nudge toward. .in \u00b6 station.in (.bp format) \u00b6 This file is needed if iout_sta=1 and is in a build point format (essentially.gr3 without the connectivity table): 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 !on (1)|off(0) flags for elev, air pressure, windx, windy, T, S, u, v, w nsta !# of stations do i=1,np i,xsta(i),ysta(i),zsta(i) !zsta(i) is z-coordinates (from vertical datum; <0 is below) enddo Also see station.in.sample in the source bundle. source_sink.in \u00b6 This input is invoked if if_source=1 , and specifies the element #\u2019s for each (volume and mass) source and sink.

This comparison is helpful for identifying numerical instabilities and for determining how complete the harmonic analysis was. Examples: FMV = 0. - do not compute any means and vars. FMV = 0.1 - compute means and vars. over final 10% of period used in harmonic analysis FMV = 1.0 - compute means and vars. over entire period used in harmonic analysis.

Notes The \u2018average |eta|\u2019 above can be used as a quick and easy way to check if the run is progressing smoothly; it is the average of the absolute value of surface elevation at all nodes. If it\u2019s too large or NaN, you have a problem. Global output \u00b6 SCHISM netcdf4 outputs are emitted in a directory called outputs/. This directory must exist or you will get an immediate crash from the model. Depending on whether or not you turned on OLDIO, the global netcdf outputs will look different. 1) Scribed I/O (OLDIO is OFF) Under this mode, the netcdf outputs are global (combined) outputs, and you can visualize or process thm using latest FORTRAN (e.g., read_output10*), matlab or python scripts, or the latest VisIT plugins. All 2D variables (e.g. elevation , sigWaveHeight etc) as well as static information such as geometry and connectivity info are grouped into out2d_*.nc . On the other hand, each 3D variable has its own output, and vector variables have X and Y components in separate outputs (e.g. horizontalVelX_*.nc and horizontalVelY_*.nc ). 2) Old I/O (OLDIO is ON) Under this mode, each MPI process will dump its own output and a post-processing script ( combin_output*.f90 ) will need to be used to combine these into global netcdf outputs. An example output file name is outputs/schout_000000_2.nc . More generally, the file name is: schout_[processor_no]_[time_block /stack #].nc Processor number The mpi_processor number starts at 0 and represents the MPI processor ID from the task that wrote the output. Time block The time blocks (\u2018stack\u2019) start from 1 and are sequential. The model buffers and writes data occasionally. Every ihfskip time steps it opens a new stack. For instance, if the time step is 120 seconds and ihfskip = 10080 , each stack will be 14-day long. \"Neat\" time lengths that will make meaningful analysis (e.g. daily, 10 days etc) are usually easiest later when you post-process; Some of the post-processing scripts will run a lot better if the length of your simulation is an even multiple of ihfskip. This can be done by altering ihfskip or the simulation length - at the risk of lengthening the simulation a bit, the latter often produces a neater result. If your simulation length is not an even multiple of the time block length, the last time block will be truncated on the last block. This will cause some minor errors and warnings in the post-processing tools. In addition, if you then restart the run it is best to repeat and overwrite the truncated block - the post-processing tools do not work well with blocks that grow and shrink in the middle of the run. If the output blocks match the end of the simulation very neatly, the model (at the time of writing) will open a new block that is very small in size. This is useful for the autocombine_MPI_elfe.pl , as the latter always waits until a new block to come out before starting to combine the previous block (and so it'd hang if the last empty block were not written out). Variable names The variables inside .nc correspond to 3D grid and state variables info at each output time step. The state variables (arrays) may have different centerings, e.g. at node/element/side. At the moment, most variables are centered around nodes (and most post-processing FORTRAN scripts also work on node-centered variables). Combine outputs The per-processor outputs need to be gathered into combined nc4 outputs first before you can visualize or post-process them. The script that does this is called combine_output11.f90 (a simple perl script autocombine_MPI_elfe.pl exists to combine all available outputs transparently; you just need to update the path to the compiled combine_output11 inside the script, and it can be launched before or after a run is done). See the header of combine_output11.f90 on sample compilation commands and usage. Once you are done combining, you should have nc4 files called something like schout_2.nc etc. Note that the stack # remains but the MPI process number is gone. There is no utility for gathering the outputs in stack/time; instead most post-processing tools are able to work with multiple stacks. Note that under OLDIO, SCHISM allows users to easily add more customized outputs, using the routine writeout_nc() inside schism_step. The combine scripts will automatically combine the additional outputs. You can visualize the combined nc4 outputs using VisIT (with SCHISM plug-ins). More info can be found in Visualization Special care for elevation outputs The elevation outputs from SCHISM are 'raw' outputs, which means users usually need to do post-processing to weed out dry instances themselves. This is a very common mistake from users. Always compare the elevation against local bottom elevation; if the total depth is less than h0 (as specified in param.nml ) you should not take the elevation outputs at face value - they should be instead NaN. For example, if the local depth is 2m, an elevation value of -3m or -1000m is the same: the node at this time instance is dry. Other global outputs The user may be interested in some maximum quantities. At the moment, SCHISM outputs two max files for elevation and depth-averaged velocity ( outputs/maxelev_* and outputs/maxdahv_* ). These files can be combined using Utility/Combining_Scripts/combine_gr3.f90 to generate maxelev.gr3 and maxdahv.gr3 . However, please exercise caution with maxelev.gr3 calculated this way because it may contain transient responses from cold start that should be disgarded. We recommend using Utility/Post-Processing-Fortran/read_output10_allnodes.f90 , which gives you more controls. Also see above for the general comments on elevation outputs. Another type of global outputs are hotstart outputs, which must be combined (using combine_hotstart7.f90 ) to generate a restart input. Station outputs \u00b6 These outputs are invoked with iout_sta=1 , and are found in outputs/staout_[1..,9] , corresponding respectively to elev, air pressure, wind u, wind v, T, S, u, v, w. Each output has a simple ASCII format: Time(sec), variable @ station 1,2,\u2026. (specified in station.in) Warning and fatal messages \u00b6 Warning message ( nonfatal_* ) contains non-fatal warnings, while fatal message file ( fatal.error ) contains fatal errors.

Comments/explanations are usually preceded by '!'.","title":"Mandatory inputs"},{"location":"input-output/param.html","text":"Please refer to sample param.nml in the source code directory (sample_inputs/) while you read the following. The file uses the FORTRAN namelist format. The order of input parameters is not important. Governing rules for this file are: lines beginning with ! are comments; blank lines are ignored; the format for each parameter is: keywords=value ; keywords are case sensitive; spaces allowed between keywords and = and value ; comments starting with ! after value are ignored; value is an integer, double, or 2-char string (use ' ' (single quotes) for this); for double, any of the format is acceptable: 40 or 40. or 4.e1 but the last 2 are preferred. Use of decimal point for integers is discouraged; if multiple entries for a parameter are found, the last one wins - please avoid this array inputs follow column major (like FORTRAN) and can spill to multiple line. The namelist file is divided into 3 major sections: CORE , OPT and SCHOUT . CORE lists out all core parameters that must be specified by the user, i.e., no defaults are provided by the code. OPT and SCHOUT sections contain optional parameters and I/O flags, all of which have default values so the user does not have to specify any of these (the values shown in the sample are defaults unless otherwise stated). SCHISM will also echo the input values in the output file outputs/param_out.nml . Most parameters (and their keywords) are explained as follows; some are \u2018developers handles\u2019 that should not be tweaked usually. Also the sample has suggested values for many parameters. Note that you do not have to follow the order below. In many cases we have grouped related parameters for easier explanation, but you should specify them on separate lines. Also you'll find additional useful info in the comments of the sample param.nml . The parameters are listed out below in alphabetic order. CORE block \u00b6 The following parameters have to be specified by the user; otherwise you may get a fatal error. The exceptions are those parameters required by optional modules (e.g., WWM), which do not need to be present if the modules are not invoked. ipre (int) \u00b6 Pre-processing flag (1: on; 0: off). ipre=0 : normal run. Pre-processing flag is very useful for checking integrity of the horizontal grid and some inputs. ipre=1 : code will output centers.bp, sidecenters.bp, (centers build point, sidcenters build point), and mirror.out and stop. Check errors in fatal.error or system outputs. Important ipre/=0 only works for single CPU! If you use scribed I/O ( OLDIO off), make sure the number of 'computes' is 1, plus extra for scribes. Also under the scribe mode, the pre-processing run will likely finish without a clean exist (as the scribe world is still initializing). Check outputs/ ( mirror.out and fatal.error ) and system outputs; if the run is finished (e.g., you see 'Pre-processing completed successfully') you can manually kill the run. ibc (int), ibtp (int) \u00b6 Barotropic/baroclinic flags. If ibc=0 , a baroclinic model is used and regardless of the value for ibtp , the transport equation is solved. If ibc=1 , a barotropic model is used, and the transport equation may (when ibtp=1 ) or may not (when ibtp=0 ) be solved; in the former case, S and T are treated as passive tracers. rnday (double) \u00b6 Total simulation time in days. dt (double) \u00b6 Time step in seconds. This is the main time step in SCHISM. The transport solvers have their own adaptive time step for subcycling to satisfy the stability constraint. msc2 (int), mdc2 (int) \u00b6 These two parameters are only used if the wave module WWM is invoked ( USE_WWM is on and icou_elfe_wwm=1 ). The values represent the spectral resolution used in WWM and must match those in wwminput.nml ; eco_class, ntracer_gen, ntracer_age, sed_class (int) \u00b6 These parameters set the # of tracer \u2018classes\u2019 for each tracer module (EcoSim, GEN, AGE and SED), and are required if these modules are invoked in makefile. Note that other tracers modules (ICM, CoSiNE) set their own # of classes. nspool, ihfskip (int) \u00b6 These two flags control the global netcdf outputs. Output is done every nspool steps, and a new output stack is opened every ihfskip steps. The code requires that ihfskip is a multiple of nspool , and nhot_write (see SCHOUT section) is a a multiple of ihfskip . nbins_veg_vert (int) \u00b6 Number of vertical bins used in vegetation option iveg=1 . OPT block \u00b6 The optional parameters below are explained in alphabetical order. The default values can be seen below and also in the sample file (sample_inputs/). dramp=1. (double), drampbc=1. (double) \u00b6 Ramp periods in days for the tides, B.C. (boundary condition) or baroclincity. If ibc=0 , the ramp-up for baroclinicity is specified with drampbc (in days). Turn off ramp-up by setting the ramp-up period <=0. The ramp function is a hyperbolic tangent function; e.g. \\(f(t) = \\tanh(2t/86400/\\text{drampbc})\\) . flag_ic(:)=1 (int array) \u00b6 Options for specifying initial tracer fields for cold start, where each array entry corresponds to individual tracer model (e.g. TEM, SAL, SED etc). If flag_ic=1 , a vertically homogeneous but horizontally varying initial tracer field is specified in inputs like temp.ic , salt.ic , [MOD]_hvar_[class #].ic etc. If flag_ic=2 , a horizontally homogeneous but vertically varying initial tracer field, prescribed in a series of z-levels, is specified in inputs like ts.ic , [MOD]_vvar_[class #].ic . For more general 3D initial tracer fields, use the hot start option. See Optional inputs section for examples of some of these inputs. Note that there is a requirement that flag_ic(1)=flag_ic(2) . h0=0.01 (double) \u00b6 Minimum depth (in m) for wetting and drying (recommended value: 1cm ). When the total depth is less than h0 , the corresponding nodes/sides/elements are marked as dry. It should always be positive. h[1,2]_bcc=50,100 (double; in meters) \u00b6 Option on how the baroclinic gradient is calculated below bottom. The 'below-bottom' gradient is zeroed out if h>=h2_bcc (i.e. like Z) or uses constant extrapolation (i.e. like terrain-following) if h<=h1_bcc(<h2_bcc) . A linear transition is used if the local depth h1_bcc<h<h2_bcc . ibcc_mean=0 (int) \u00b6 Mean T,S profile option. If ibcc_mean=1 (or ihot=0 and flag_ic(1:2)=2 ), mean T/S profile is read in from ts.ic , and will be removed when calculating baroclinic force. No ts.ic is needed if ibcc_mean=0 . ic_elev=0 (int), nramp_elev=0 (int) (int) \u00b6 Elevation initial condition flag for cold start only ( ihot=0 ). If ic_elev=1 , elev.ic (in *.gr3 format) is needed to specify the initial condition (I.C.) Otherwise elevation is initialized to 0 everywhere (cold start only) or from the elevation values in hotstart.nc (hotstart option). If ic_elev=1 , the user can ramp up the elevation smoothly at the boundary starting from the specified elev.ic or hotstart.nc (if \\(ihot\\neq 0\\) ) by setting nramp_elev=1 (and the ramp-up period in this case is dramp ). It's usually OK to use nramp_elev=1 under either cold or hot start. icou_elfe_wwm=0, iwbl=0 (int) \u00b6 Coupler flag with WWM; needed if USE_WWM pre-processor is enabled. icou_elfe_wwm = 0 : no feedback from WWM to SCHISM (decoupled); 1 : coupled SCHISM-WWM. iwbl=1 : modified Grant-Madsen formulation for wave enhanced boundary layer; =2: Soulsby (1997) formulation; =0 : off. If icou_elfe_wwm=1 , additional parameters are: nstep_wwm=1 (int): call WWM every nstep_wwm time steps; hmin_radstress=1.0 (double): minimum total water depth in meters used only in radiation stress calculation; the radiation stress is zero if local depth <hmin_radstress . In addition, there are parameters related to Vortex Formalism of Bennice and Ardhuin (2008). ics=1 (int) \u00b6 Coordinate frame flag. If ics=1 , Cartesian coordinates are used; if ics=2 , both hgrid.ll and hgrid.gr3 use degrees latitude/longitude (and they should be identical to each other in this case). ielm_transport = 0, max_subcyc = 10 (int) \u00b6 Hybrid ELM-FV transport for performance. If ielm_transport=1 , the hybrid scheme is invoked and max_subcyc represents the max # of subcycling per time step in transport allowed; if the actual # of subcycling in a prism at a time step exceeds this threshold, more efficient ELM transport is used locally (at the expense of mass conservation and accuracy, so make sure this option is used sparingly). ieos_type=0, ieos_pres=0 (int) \u00b6 By default, use the nonlinear equation of state: ieos_type=0 . ieos_pres=0,1 will turn on/off hydrostatic pressure effects. If the potential temperature is used, the pressure effect has been accounted for, so ieos_pres=0. if_source=0 (int), dramp_ss=2. (double), lev_tr_source(:)=-9 (int array) \u00b6 Point sources/sinks option (0: no; 1: on). If if_source=1 , needs source_sink.in , vsource.th , vsink.th , and msource.th (see sample files in the source code directory src/ for their formats). If if_source=-1 , the input is source.nc , which includes element list inside and allows for different time steps and # of records for volume/mass source/sinks. If if_source/=0 , specify ramp-up period (in days) with dramp_ss (no ramp-up if <=0). The tracers are injected into an element at a particular level, as specified by lev_tr_source(1:ntr) (where ntr is total # of tracer modules, i.e. 1 input level per module). The code will extrapolate below bottom/above surface if necessary, so e.g., '-9' means bottom. To inject at all levels, set the level at '0'. AGE module The AGE mpdule has its own way of injecting age tracers (see below), so make sure the age concentrations from all sources are all -9999. in msource.th so as to not interfere. level_age(:)=-999 (int array) \u00b6 If USE_AGE is on, this array specifies the vertical level indices used to inject age tracers. You only need to specify this for the first half of the tracer classes. Use -999 to inject the tracer at all levels. iflux=0 (int) \u00b6 Parameter for checking volume and tracer mass conservation. If turned on ( =1 or 2 ), the conservation will be checked in regions specified by fluxflag.prop . iflux=2 would produce mroe detailed volume/mass fluxes outputs. iharind=0 (int) \u00b6 Harmonic analysis flag. If \\(iharind \\neq 0\\) , an input harm.in is needed. ihconsv=0, isconsv=0 (int) \u00b6 Heat budget and salt conservation models flags. If ihconsv=0 , the heat budget model is not used. If ihconsv=1 , a heat budget model is invoked, and a number of netcdf files for radiation flux input are read in from sflux/sflux_rad*.nc . If isconsv=1 , the evaporation and precipitation model is evoked but the user needs to turn on the pre-processing flag PREC_EVAP in makefile and recompile. In this case, ihconsv must be 1 , and additional netcdf inputs for precipitation ( sflux/sflux_prc*.nc ) are required. The user can also turn on USE_BULK_FAIRALL in the makefile to use COARE algorithm instead of the default Zeng's bulk aerodynamic module. i_hmin_airsea_ex (int), hmin_airsea_ex (double; in meters) \u00b6 Option to locally turn off heat exchange. i_hmin_airsea_ex=1 : exchange turned off if local grid depth<hmin_airsea_ex i_hmin_airsea_ex=2 : exchange turned off if local water depth<hmin_airsea_ex i_hmin_salt_ex (int), hmin_salt_ex (double; in meters) \u00b6 Similar to i_hmin_airsea_ex and hmin_airsea_ex . iprecip_off_bnd (int) \u00b6 If iprecip_off_bnd /=0, preciptation will be turned off near land boundary. This is useful for islands sitting on very steep slopes. stemp_stc (double), stemp_dz(1:2) (double) \u00b6 Option to account for sediment-water heat exchange on bottom temperature. stemp_stc is heat transfer coefficient \\(W/m^2/K\\) (so stemp_stc=0 would turn this option off). stemp_dz(1) is the equivalent sediment buffer depth (m) for heat into sediment, and stemp_dz(2) is the equivalent sediment buffer depth (m) for heat out of sediment. ihdif=0 (int) \u00b6 Flag to use non-zero horizontal diffusivity. If ihdif=0 , it is not used. If \\(ihdif \\neq 0\\) , input hdif.gr3 is needed. ihot=0 (int) \u00b6 Hot start flag. If ihot=0 , cold start; if \\(ihot \\neq 0\\) , hot start from hotstart.nc . If ihot=1 , the time and time step are reset to zero, and outputs start from t=0 accordingly (and you need to adjust other inputs like .th etc). If ihot=2 , the run (and outputs) will continue from the time specified in hotstart.nc . Note With ihot=2 ,you do not need to adjust other inputs but you do need to make sure flux.out is inside outputs/ (even if you used iflux=0 ). If you used \\(iout\\_sta \\neq 0\\) , make sure staout_* are inside outputs/ as well. This is because the code will try to append to these outputs upon restart, and would crash if it cannot find them. On the other hand, you don't need to have the global outputs in outputs/ because nhot_write is a multiple of ihfskip so the new outputs will be written into a new stack. In fact, you can change the core count upon hotstart this way. Under ihot=1 , beware the use of ramps. Since the time origin has been reset, the ramps need to be adjusted accordingly. For example, if the field has been fully warmed up at the hotstart, then set ramps=0. ihydraulics=0 (int) \u00b6 Hydraulic model option. If \\(ihydraulics \\neq 0\\) , hydraulics.in is required (cf. hydraulics user manual). iloadtide=0 (int), loadtide_coef (double) \u00b6 Option to specify Self Attraction and Loading (SAL) tide, usually used for basin- or global-scale applications. If iloadtide=0 , SAL is off. If iloadtide=1 , the SAL input is interpolated values from a tide database, e.g., FES2014, given in loadtide_[FREQ].gr3 , where [FREQ] are frequency names (shared with tidal potential, in upper cases like M2) and the two 'depths' inside are amplitude (m) and phases (degrees behind GMT). In this option, SAL is lumped into tidal potential so it shares some parameters with tidal potential in bctides.in (cut-off depth, frequencies). If iloadtide=2 or 3, use a simple scaling for gravity approach (in this option, SAL is applied everywhere and does not share parameters with tidal potential). If iloadtide=2 , a simple scaling specified by loadtide_coef is used to reduce the gravity. If iloadtide=3 , the scaling is dependent on the local depth a la Stepanov & Hughes (2004), with a maximum value of loadtide_coef . imm=0, ibdef=10 (int) \u00b6 Bed deformation option. Default: 0 (no bed deformation); 1 : with bed deformation (needs ibdef (# of steps during which deformation occurs), and bdef.gr3 ); 2: 3D bottom deformation (need to interact with code). indvel=0 (int), ihorcon=0 (int), hvis_coef0=0.025 (double), ishapiro=1, niter_shap=1 (int), shapiro0=0.5 (double) \u00b6 These parameters (and inter_mom below) control the numerical dissipation in momentum solver; see SCHISM paper (Zhang et al. 2016) for details. indvel determines the method of converting side velocity to node velocity. If indvel=0 , the node velocity is allowed to be discontinuous across elements and additional viscosity/filter is needed to filter out grid-scale noises (spurious 'modes'). If indvel=1 , an inverse-distance interpolation procedure is used instead and the node velocity is continuous across elements; this method requires no additional viscosity/filter unless kriging ELM is used ( inter_mom >0 ). In general, indvel=0 leads to smaller numerical dissipation and better accuracy, but does generally require a velocity B.C. Due to spurious modes or dispersion (oscillation), viscosity/filter should be applied. ihorcon=0 :no horizontal viscosity; =1 : Laplacian (implemented as a filter); =2 : bi-harmonic. For ihorcon/=0 , hvis_coef0 specifies the non-dimensional viscosity. In addition to the viscosity, one can add the Shapiro filter, which is specified by ishapiro =0,\u00b11, 2 (turn off/on Shapiro filter). If ishapiro=1 , shapiro0 specifies the Shapiro filter strength. If ishapiro=-1 , an input called shapiro.gr3 is required which specifies the filter strength at each node (there is a pre-proc script gen_slope_filter2.f90 for this). If ishapiro=2 , a Smagorinsky-like filter is applied and shpiro.gr3 specifies the coefficient \\((\\gamma_0)\\) , which is typically 10- \\(10^3\\) : \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq01} \\begin{aligned} \\gamma &= 0.5\\tanh (\\gamma_0 \\Delta t \\hat \\mu)\\\\ \\hat\\mu &= \\sqrt{u_x^2 + v_y^2 + \\frac{(u_y + v_x)^2}{2}} \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] If ishapiro/=0 , niter_shap specifies the number of times the filter is applied. For non-eddying regime applications (nearshore, estuary, river), an easiest option is: indvel=0 , ishapiro=1 ( shapiro0=0.5 ), ihorcon= inter_mom=0 . For applications that include the eddying regime, grid resolution in the eddying regime needs to vary smoothly (Zhang et al. 2016), and the user needs to tweak dissipation carefully. A starting point can be: indvel=ishapiro=inter_mom=0 , ihorcon=2 , hvis_coef0=0.025 . If the amount of dissipation is insufficient in the non-eddying regime, consider using ishapiro=-1 , with an appropriate shapiro.gr3 to turn on Shapiro filter locally to add dissipation, or use ishapiro=2 and shapiro0=1000 . inter_mom=0, kr_co=1 (int) \u00b6 Interpolation method at foot of characteristic line during ELM. inter_mom=0 : default linear interpolation; =1 : dual kriging method. If inter_mom=-1 , the depth in krvel.gr3 (0 or 1) will determine the order of interpolation (linear or kriging). If the kriging ELM is used, the general covariance function is specified in kr_co : 1: linear \\(f(h)=-h\\) ; 2: \\((h^2*log(h))\\) ; 3: cubic \\((h^3)\\) ; 4: \\((-h^5)\\) . In general, indvel=0 should be used with inter_mom=0 or inter_mom=1, kr_co=1,2 to avoid large dispersion (with additional viscosity/filter also). indvel=1 can be used with any covariance function without viscosity/filter. inu_elev=0, inu_uv=0 (int) \u00b6 Sponge layer for elevation and velocity (which is rarely used in SCHISM). Relaxation/nudging of a generic variable is implemented as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq02} \\widetilde \\varphi = (1-\\gamma)\\varphi + \\gamma\\varphi_{target} \\end{equation}\\] which is a discrete analogue of the restoration equation: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq03} \\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\Delta t} \\left( \\varphi_{target} - \\varphi \\right) \\end{equation}\\] If inu_elev=0 , no relaxation is applied to elevation. If inu_elev=1 , relaxation constants are specified in elev_nudge.gr3 (depth=0 means no relaxation, depth=1 means strongest nudging) and the elevations are relaxed toward 0. Similarly for inu_uv (with input uv_nudge.gr3 ). inu_tr(:)=0 (int array), nu_sum_mult(int), step_nu_tr=86400. (double) \u00b6 Nudging flag for tracer models (e.g. temperature), and nudging step (in sec). When inu_tr=0 , no nudging is done. When inu_tr=1 , relax back to initial conditions. When inu_tr=2 , nudge to values specified in [MOD]_nu.nc , which has a time step of step_nu_tr (in sec). If inu_tr\u22600 , the horizontal relaxation factors are specified in [MOD]_nudge.gr3 (as depths info), and the vertical relaxation factors are specified as a linear function of depths with: vnh[1,2] (transitional depths) and vnf[1,2] (relaxation constants at the 2 depths). The final relaxation constant is either the sum (if nu_sum_mult=1 ) or product (if nu_sum_mult=2 ) of the two, i.e. (horizontal + or * vertical relaxation factors) times dt . inunfl=0 (int) \u00b6 Choice of inundation algorithm. inunfl=1 can be used if the horizontal resolution is fine enough, and this is critical for tsunami simulations. Otherwise use inunfl=0 . iveg=0 (int) \u00b6 Parameters for submerged or emergent vegetation. If iveg/=0 , you need to supply 4 extra inputs: veg_cd.gr3 (form drag coefficient), veg_D.gr3 (depth is stem diameter in meters); veg_N.gr3 (depth is # of stems per m2); and veg_h.gr3 (height of canopy in meters). These are original, unbent values for the vegetation. If iveg=1 , the vertical variation/scalings for these parameters are specified for nbins_veg_vert vertical bins, with veg_vert_z(1:nbins_veg_vert+1) specifying the distance from bed (in meters) for each bin (ascending order starting from 0). The vertical scalings are given by veg_vert_scale_[cd,N,D](1:nbins_veg_vert+1) . If iveg=2 , flexible vegetation formulation of Ganthy et al. (2011) is used. Parameters needed for this case are: non-dimensional Leaf Area Index veg_lai and veg_cw (a non-dimensional calibration coefficient for diameter of bent leaf). itr_met=3 (int), h_tvd=5. (double) \u00b6 Transport option for all tracers. itr_met=3 for TVD, and itr_met=4 for 3rd order WENO. h_tvd specifies the transition depth (in meters) between upwind and higher-order schemes; i.e. more efficient upwind is used when the local depth < h_tvd . Also in this case, you can additionally toggle between upwind and TVD by specifying regions in tvd.prop . The TVD limiter function is specified in TVD_LIM in mk/include_modules (for code efficiency purpose). If itr_met=3 , 2 tolerances are also required (use recommended values). If itr_met=4 (WENO), there are several additional parameters. The most important ones are epsilon[12] , which controls the numerical dispersion for the 2nd and 3rd-order WENO respectively (note that the code will decide which order is used at each prism based on geometric constraints). itur=0 (int) \u00b6 Turbulence closure model selection. If itur=0 , constant diffusivities are used for momentum and transport, and the diffusivities are specified in dfv0 , dfh0 . If itur=-2 , vertically homogeneous but horizontally varying diffusivities are used, which are read in from hvd.mom and hvd.tran . If itur=-1 , horizontally homogeneous but vertically varying diffusivities are used, which are read in from vvd.dat . If itur=2 , the zero-equation Pacanowski and Philander closure is used. In this case, a few extra parameters are required: h1_pp , vdmax_pp1 , vdmin_pp1 , tdmin_pp1 , h2_pp , vdmax_pp2 , vdmin_pp2 , tdmin_pp2 . Eddy viscosity is computed as: \\(\\text{vdiff}=\\text{vdiff_max}/(1+\\text{rich})^2+\\text{vdiff_min}\\) , and diffusivity \\(\\text{tdiff}=\\text{vdiff_max}/(1+\\text{rich})^2+\\text{tdiff_min}\\) , where \\(\\text{rich}\\) is a Richardson number. The limits ( vdiff_max , vdiff_min and tdiff_min ) vary linearly with depth between depths h1_pp and h2_pp . If itur=3 , then the two-equation closure schemes from the GLS model of Umlauf and Burchard (2003) are used. In this case, 2 additional parameters are required: mid , stab , which specify the closure scheme and stability function used: mid= MY is Mellor & Yamada; KL is GLS as k-kl; KE is GLS as \\(k-\\varepsilon\\) ; KW is GLS as \\(k-\\omega\\) ; UB is Umlauf & Burchard's optimal. stab=GA is Galperin's clipping (only for MY); KC is Kantha & Clayson's stability function). Also the user needs to specify max/min diffusivity/viscosity in diffmax.gr3 and diffmin.gr3 , as well as a surface mixing length scale constant xlsc0 . If itur=4 , GOTM turbulence model is invoked; the user needs to turn on pre-processing flag USE_GOTM in makefile and recompile (GOTM5.2 uses cmake, so does not need to be pre-compiled). In this case, the minimum and maximum viscosity/diffusivity are still specified in diffmin.gr3 and diffmax.gr3 . There are some ready-made samples for this input in the source code bundle. A key parameter is the steady state Richardson number. If you wish to tune some parameters inside, you may consult gotm.net for more details. Note GOTM has only been tested up to v5.2, not newer versions of GOTM. Using itur=3 generally gave similar results, but GOTM can produce substantially better stratification in some cases. nadv=1 (int), dtb_min=10, dtb_max=30 (double) \u00b6 Advection on/off option. If nadv=0 , advection is selectively turned off based on the input file adv.gr3 . If nadv=1 or 2 , advection is on for the whole domain, and backtracking is done using either Euler or 2nd-order Runge-Kutta scheme. dtb_[min,max] are min/max sub-steps allowed in btrack; actual sub-steps are calculated based on local flow gradients. nchi=0 (int) \u00b6 Bottom friction option. If nchi=-1 , and Manning's \\(n\\) is specified in manning.gr3 . If nchi=0 , spatially varying drag coefficients are read in from drag.gr3 (as depth info). For nchi=1 , bottom roughnesses (in meters) are read in from rough.gr3 . If nchi=-1 , an additional parameter is required: hmin_man (in meters) which sets the minimum depth used in the Manning formulation. If nchi=1 , one additional parameter is required: dzb_min (in meters). In this case the drag coefficients are calculated using the log drag law when the bottom cell thickness \\(\\delta_b>=\\text{dzb_min}\\) ; when \\(\\delta_b<\\text{dzb_min}\\) , \\(\\text{Cd}=\\text{Cdmax}\\) , where \\(\\text{Cdmax}=\\text{Cd}(\\delta_b=\\text{dzb_min})\\) . This is to avoid exaggeration of \\(\\text{Cd}\\) in very shallow water. ncor=0 (int) \u00b6 Coriolis option. If ncor=0 or -1 , a constant Coriolis parameter is specified. If ncor=0 , coricoef specifies the Coriolis factor. If ncor=-1 , rlatitude specifies the mean latitude used to calculate the Coriolis factor. If ncor=1 , a variable Coriolis parameter, based either on a beta-plane approximation ( ics=1 ) or on the latitude-dependent Coriolis ( ics=2 ), is used, with the lat/lon coordinates read in from hgrid.ll . For ics=1 , the center of beta-plane approximation must be correctly specified in sfea0 . nws=0 (int), drampwind=1. (double), iwind_form=1 (int), iwindoff(int), wtiminc=dt (double) \u00b6 Wind forcing options and the interval (in seconds) with which the wind input is read in. If nws=0 , no wind is applied (and wtiminc becomes unused). If nws=1 , constant wind is applied to the whole domain at any given time, and the time history of wind is read in from wind.th . If nws=2 , spatially and temporally variable wind is applied and the input consists of a number of netcdf files in the directory sflux/ . The option nws=3 is reserved for coupling with atmospheric model via ESMF caps. If nws=4 , the required input atmos.nc specifies wind and pressure at each node and at time of multiple of wtiminc . Additional inputs (e.g. heat fluxes) are needed if heat/salt exchange module is invoked. If nws=-1 (requires USE_PAHM), use Holland parametric wind model (barotropic only with wind and atmos. pressure). In this case, the Holland model is called every step so wtiminc is not used. An extra input is needed: hurricane-track.dat . If nws>0 , the ramp-up period (in days) is specified with drampwind . Also the user has the option to scale the wind speed using iwindoff =1 (which requires an additional input windfactor.gr3 ). The wind stress formulation is selected with iwind_form . If nws=2, ihconsv=1 && iwind_form=0 , the stress is calculated from heat exchange routine. If nws=1 or 4 , or nws=2 && ihconsv=0 , or nws=2 && iwind_form\u2260 0 , the stress is calculated from Pond & Pichard formulation (originally from Garret) if iwind_form=-1 , or from Hwang (2018) if iwind_form=1 . If WWM is enabled and icou_elfe_wwm > 0 and iwind_form=-2 , stress is calculated by WWM. rho0=1000, shw=4184. (double) \u00b6 Reference water density for Boussinesq approximation and specific heat of water in J/kg/K. rmaxvel=10. (double) \u00b6 Maximum velocity. This is needed mainly for the air-water exchange as the latter may blow up if the water velocity is above 20m/s. s1_mxbnt=0.5, s2_mxnbnt=3.5 (double) \u00b6 Dimensioning parameters used in inter-subdomain backtracking. Start from s[12]_mxnbt=0.53 , and increase them (gradually) if you get a fatal error like \u201cbtrack: overflow\u201d. Accuracy is not affected by the choice of these two parameters; these only affect memory consumption. slam0=-124, sfea0=45 (double) \u00b6 Centers of projection used to convert lat/lon to Cartesian coordinates. These are used if a variable Coriolis parameter is employed (ncor=1). start_year=2000, start_month=1, start_day=1 (int), start_hour=0, utc_start=8 (double) \u00b6 Starting time for simulation. utc_start is hours behind the GMT, and is used to adjust time zone. For example, utc_start=5 is US Eastern Time, and utc_start= -8 is Beijing Time. Note SCHISM's view of the time origin is relatively simple. The code starts from t=0 and marches with time step dt under cold start. It starts from a specified time upon hot start. There are only 2 exceptions: (1) in air-sea exchange ( ihconsv=1 ), the origin info (including utc_start ) specified in these parameters will be compared against the time origins in each sflux file to determine the starting stack; (2) WWM manages its own time origins in wwminput.nml ; it's advisable to align the latter with SCHISM's origin. thetai=0.6 (double) \u00b6 Implicitness parameter (between 0.5 and 1). Recommended value: 0.6. Use '1' to get maximum stability for strong wet/dry. SCHOUT block \u00b6 iout_sta=0, nspool_sta=10 (int) \u00b6 Station output flag. If iout_sta\u22600 , an input station.in is needed. In addition, nspool_sta specifies the spool for station output. In this case, make sure nhot_write is a multiple of nspool_sta . iof_ugrid (int) \u00b6 UGRID option for outputs under scribed IO. If iof_ugrid/=0, outputs will also have UGRID metadata (at the expense of file size). nc_out =1(int) \u00b6 Main switch to turn on/off netcdf outputs, useful for other programs (e.g., ESMF) to control outputs. nhot=0, nhot_write=8640 (int) \u00b6 Hot start output control parameters. If nhot=0 , no hot start output is generated. If nhot=1 , hotstart output is named outputs/hotstart_[process_id]_[it].nc every nhot_write steps, where it is the corresponding time iteration number. nhot_write must be a multiple of ihfskip and nspool_sta . If you want to hotstart a run from step it , you need to combine all process-specific hotstart outputs into a hotstart.nc using combine_hotstart7.f90 ( ./combine_hotstart7 -h for help). iof_* (int) \u00b6 Global output (in netcdf4 format) options, where * stands for module name (e.g. \"hydro\", \"wwm\" etc). The frequency of global outputs is controlled by 2 parameters in CORE : nspool and ihfskip . Output is done every nspool steps, and a new output stack is created every ihfskip steps. Under OLDIO, the outputs are named as outputs/schout_[MPI process id]_[1,2,3,...].nc etc. The combine scripts are then used to gather each output variable across all MPI processes into a single output, e.g., schout_[1,2,3\u2026].nc . With new scribed I/O, outputs look like out2d_1,2,3\u2026].nc etc (and no combining is necessary). In this mode, all 2D outputs are found in out2d* and each 3D output (note that vector output like horizontal velocity counts as 2 outputs) has its own netcdf files, e.g. salinity_[1,2..].nc , horizontalVelX_[1,2..].nc etc. Each output variable is controlled by an I/O flag in param.nml . We only show a few examples below; the rest are similar. Note that variables may be centered at nodes/sides/elements horizontally and whole/half levels vertically. However, at the moment most variables are centered at nodes and whole levels, and most post-processing FORTRAN scripts can only handle this type of outputs (while VisIT can handle other types). iof_hydro(1) = 1 !global elevation output control. If iof_hydro(1)=0, no global elevation is recorded. !If iof_hydro(1)= 1, global elevation for each node is recorded. !The output is either starting from scratch or appended to existing ones depending !on ihot. Some outputs are conditional upon you turn on certain module; e.g. iof_sed(7) = 1 won\u2019t output the bottom depth change unless you turn on USE_SED in makefile. Some \u2018native\u2019 variables (e.g., element- or side-centered) are: iof_hydro(27) = 1 !horizontal velocity defined at side [m/s].

If indvel=1 , an inverse-distance interpolation procedure is used instead and the node velocity is continuous across elements; this method requires no additional viscosity/filter unless kriging ELM is used ( inter_mom >0 ).

Since a barotropic model cannot do heat/salt exchange properly, these two types of sflux inputs should not be used there. To impose rainfall in a barotropic model, you have to use the source/sink option if_source by converting rainfall rate into sources. We have NARR sflux files from 1979-present, but cannot upload all of them to the web due to disk space limitation. You can find some samples at http://ccrm.vims.edu/yinglong/wiki_files/NARR/ . Two sources of data are allowed for each type of .nc files, and the relative priority is fixed by the file name. For instance sflux_air_1.0003.nc might be blended with a file called sflux_air_2.0003.nc . The \".0003\" component of the name represents the order of the file within the stack of provided input files. For instance, there might be a new file ( 0001 , 0002 , 0003 ) produced every 12 hours in a forecast cycle. Interpolation and prioritization \u00b6 Using air as an example, it is assumed that the file sflux_air_2.0001.nc is more resolved or accurate than sflux_air_1.0001.nc. The two will be blended in the model in a way that favors the \u2018_2\u2019 file. This blending of the fields is only adjustable in the code as described in notes below. The default in sflux_9c.F90 is a 99:1 blend of the \u2018_2\u2019 file to the \u2018_1\u2019 file. As was remarked above, the files are arranged temporally in a stack of files starting with \".0001\". Given the sequence of forecasting and analysis, it is common for atmospheric files to overlap. A file might begin with a brief period of data assimilation plus a few days of forecast. SCHISM assumes that a new file indicates the injection of information, so when it encounters overlap, it advances to the later file. Using NARR files for your simulation (North America only) \u00b6 First, make sure the NARR grid covers your hgrid.ll to ensure proper sptatial interpolation. In your run directory, mkdir sflux and inside it, create symbolic links to the NARR files. e.g., if you run starts from June 10, 2004 and ends June 20, 2004, then sflux_air_1.0001.nc --> narr_air.2004_06_10.nc sflux_air_1.0002.nc --> narr_air.2004_06_11.nc ... sflux_air_1.0011.nc --> narr_air.2004_06_20.nc sflux_air_1.0012.nc --> narr_air.2004_06_21.nc # (extra day to account for time zone difference) Similarly for sflux_rad_*.nc and sflux_prc_*.nc . As described above, the number \"1\" after \"air_\" denotes the first data set used, with the second set taking priority; you can use up to 2 sets in SCHISM (which combines them with some given weights set in sflux_subs.F90); we only use 1 set in this example. Global sflux - NCEP CFSR \u00b6 This web site has many global atmospheric model files, and a very useful source is the NCEP's CFSR. Note that you need to register yourself at the site first. Simply select 'NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR)', and then CFSRv2. Under 'Data Access' you can get a sub-set (instead of global files). Then select all variable required by SCHISM: Wind u,v at 10m (Air) pressure reduced to MSL (Air) temperature at 2m AGL Specific humidity at 2m AGL Downward longwave radiation flux at ground level Downward shortwave radiation flux at ground level Precipitation rate at ground level In the new window, select output format as netcdf, and remember to restrict the vertical heights for each variable. Note that pressure is given at a different grid than other variables and so you'd do it separately. You can select a region and computational grid and temporal resolution etc and then submit the request. Once you have downloaded the (compressed) netcdf files, you can use these 3 matlab scripts to process them into sflux_[air,rad,prc]*.nc . Note that the files are bundled differently for difference period (e.g. before and after Oct. 1, 2011) and so you may need to modify those scripts slightly. Preparing your own sflux inputs \u00b6 After familiarize yourself with the NARR files and their format, you may embark on creating your own nc files. The best way is to modify existing matlab scripts ( src/Utility/Sflux_nc/readnc*.m ) included in the source code bundle, which have extensively in-line comments to guide you along the way. Since the time and space interpolation will be used to interpolate sflux info onto hgrid.ll at runtime, you need to make sure that the lon/lat grid in sflux_*_1.* covers hgrid.ll , and the union of time records in sflux*.nc covers the entire simulation period. The time zone info is given by utc_start , and you may pre-pend some records if this value is negative (eastern hemisphere) or append if it is positive. Even if utc_start=0 , the code will need at least one time record beyond rnday for interpolation; simply duplicate the record at rnday if you do not have such info. Wind convention u-component is eastward, v-comp. is northward (normal math convention, not compass convention) Additional files windrot_geo2proj.gr3 : rotates winds in case they do not align with coordinate axes, i.e. lat/lon Some details from sflux_9c.F90 Of all attributes in nc file, only 'base_date' is required. This is the time origin used in each file and the \u2018time\u2019 is then the offset (in days) from this origin. Note that the last number (hour) is NOT used and UTC is always assumed in each file. Use utc_start in param.nml to adjust time zone; The grids for air, rad and prc can be different (but must be the same within each type and each source). Additional requirements for the structured grid in .nc: lon,lat give x,y coord., nx is # of pts in x.

The challenge here is mostly related to the different physics requirements rather than numerics between eddying and non-eddying regimes. Danilov & Wang (2015) demonstrated that the mesh in the eddying regime should vary smoothly to not distort eddying processes. This is understandable also because the bathymetric variations in the deep ocean do not play as an important role as in non-eddying regime, so there is no compelling reason to drastically vary mesh resolution there. One common mistake users make is to over-refine in eddying and transitional regimes. This actually violate the hydrostatic assumption (the horizontal scale >> vertical scale). For example, setting mesh resolution at 500m at 500m depth would likely lead to spurious 'upwelling' (Figure 2 ). To get a good SCHISM baroclinic setup for this type of applications, one needs to pay attention to Horizontal mesh Vertical grid: use \\(\\text{LSC}^2\\) , and at least resolve the surface layer Parameterization: especially important are parameters that control momentum dissipation ( indvel , ihorcon , ishapiro , dt ) The example of South China Sea (SCS) shown below illustrates this type of mistakes made by users (Figure 1 ). A particularly severe challenge is a transitional regime (between eddying and non-eddying regimes) with steep slopes that tend to excite parasitic noises (if the mesh resolution is too fine), and a common symptom for this manifests itself as spurious upwelling of cold water (Figure 2 ). (a) \u2018Wrong\u2019 map for SCS, showing multiple issues with grid design. Steep slopes are prevalent in this region, near small islands and continental shelf breaks. (b) grid near Spratly, showing excessively high resolution in deep water (0.01 degree ~ 1 km). Surface temperature (SST) resulted from the grid generated from Figure 1, showing the excessive spurious upwelling of cold water. For meshgen, always start with modest and quasi-uniform resolution for eddying regime. In SMS, this can be achieved with fewer constraints in the form of arcs. High resolution (<=2km) in deep water (h>=1km) should be avoided (Figure 1 ). At steep slopes, this means that an \u2018outer arc\u2019 (in SMS map) may be needed. With the corrected mesh, the noise is greatly reduced: the remaining noise in southern Philippines can be rectified by adding outer arcs there (Figure 4 ). A corrected SMS map file. Outer arcs are added near shelf break of west coast of Luzon and Spratly Islands, but are missing in the southern Philippines. SST calculated from the corrected grid. The remaining \u2018upwelling\u2019 in the circled area is due to the missing outer arcs in that area (cf. Figure 3). Parameters dt=100s (slightly larger values like 120 s should also work), indvel=0 , ihorcon=2 , ishapiro= -1 . shapiro.gr3 is then generated using gen_slope_filter2.f90 by using larger filter strengths near steep slopes (and small elsewhere). Figure 5a shows the resultant input. In general, the momentum needs to be stabilized with larger viscosity near steep slopes, as bi-harmonic viscosity alone is not sufficient there. Other pre-processing is same as before: the I.C. and B.C. can be derived from HYCOM and FES 2014 (i.e. use type \u20185\u2019 for both elevation and velocity B.C.). In addition, tracers are relaxed to HYCOM values near open boundaries (Figure 5b ). Required pro-processing scripts can be found in Utility/ . Starting from v5.9, users can also try the new Smagorinsky\u2013like filter option ( ishapiro=2 ) with a proper shapiro0 . (a) Filter strength input (shapiro.gr3). Larger values are used near steep slopes. (b) Nudging strength input (TEM_nudge.gr3, SAL_nudge.gr3), generated from gen_slope_filter2.f90, with maximum time scale of 1 day. The meshing challenge is particularly acute when one deals with islands sitting on top of steep slopes. Figure 6 shows 3 attempts to add high resolution near Guam in the Pacific basin mesh. The mesh resolution in the surrounding deep ocean is about 5km, and we need to refine the mesh to about 30m around Guam. The Apra Harbor jetty that requires higher resolution happens to be located close to a steep slope. Combination of wet/dry and forced sharp transition in \u2018new14\u2019 and \u2018new15\u2019 led to spread of upwelled water there. Removing an inner arc in \u2018new15\u2019 helped smoother transition from the outer arc to the inner arc and thus alleviated the upwelling issue. In \u2018new16\u2019, we made more \u2018room\u2019 for transition by moving the inner arc away from the outer arc and coarsening it a little (to match the resolution of the outer arc), thus further reducing the upwelling. However, we had to add more internal arcs to provide adequate resolution nearshore (otherwise the nearshore area would be represented by a few skew elements that have side lengths of a few km\u2019s on the outside and 30m on the inside). Figure 7 shows the details of \u2018new16\u2019 and final mesh. Note that in all three maps, we used 500m isobaths for the outer arc (as representation of start of eddying regime) but the arc veered to 1km isobaths near the harbor as a way to make more room for transition there. Three SMS maps (top) and corresponding results for SST. Details for map \u2018new16\u2019 and the final mesh around Apra Harbor. Skew elements nearshore are fine. Sub-mesoscale If sub-mesoscale processes are of interest, one may need to reduce time step below 100 sec or apply some special parameterization such as niter_shap etc. References \u00b6 Danilov, Sergey & Wang, Qiang.

The numbers are local indices that correpond to each neighbor of the center cell. Calculate flow accumulation Flow accumulation is the total number of cells passing through each (raster) cell. With flow accumulations, we can apply a presccribed threshold to determine which cells should be included in the final digital stream network. The details of the algorithm can be found in Ye et al.

Usage \u00b6 RiverMapper requires two inputs: *.tif, which are DEM tiles in lon/lat from one or more sources. a shapefile with a 'LineString' type, which contains a 1D river network. Note The 1D river network can be any reasonable approximation of the thalwegs. It can be: extracted from DEM using the method presented in the previous section or duplicated from the river network of a hydrological model such as the National Water Model or manually drawn for quick local touch-ups The outputs include: \"total_river_arcs.map\", which contains river arcs to be used for the final meshing in SMS. other *.map files for diagnostic purposes. A sample output looks like this: Sample applications \u00b6 To test the RiverMapper tool, you can start by extracting the \"RiverMapper_Samples/\" directory from RiverMapper_Samples.tar . Find the following two subdirectories: \"Serial\" and \"Parallel\", which provide sample applications for meshing watershed rivers in a smaller domain and a larger domain respectively. Each subdirectory contains a sample Python script and the necessary input files. Note that these two samples use the default settings suitable for small watershed rivers that are narrower than a few hundred meters. Similar settings are used in the latest version of NOAA's operational forecast STOFS3D Atlantic . If you are interested in meshing rivers with a wider range of widths, check samples with more parameter settings below . Meshing watershed rivers in a small domain (Serial mode) \u00b6 For a small domain (covering one or two states), a direct function call to the serial \"make_river_map\" suffices. See the sample script: RiverMapper_Samples/Serial/sample_serial.py , which reads: from RiverMapper.make_river_map import make_river_map if __name__ == \"__main__\" : ''' A sample serial application of RiverMapper ''' make_river_map ( tif_fnames = [ './Inputs/DEMs/GA_dem_merged_ll.tif' ], thalweg_shp_fname = './Inputs/Shapefiles/GA_local.shp' , output_dir = './Outputs/' , ) Under the directory \"RiverMapper_Samples/Serial/\", execute the serial script like this: ./sample_serial.py Note Although only one DEM tile is used in this example, but multiple DEM tiles are allowed. If the tiles are from different DEM sources, they should be arranged from high to low priority in the list. Tiles from the high priority DEM source should have high fidelity and high resolution. The script allows DEM tiles of different sizes and shapes. Meshing rivers in a large domain (Parallel mode) \u00b6 For a large domain such as STOFS3D Atlantic , a parallel driver is provided to automatically group thalwegs based on their parent tiles, then distribute the groups to parallel processors. The sample parallel script is: RiverMapper_Samples/Parallel/sample_parallel.py , which reads: from mpi4py import MPI import os from RiverMapper.river_map_mpi_driver import river_map_mpi_driver if __name__ == \"__main__\" : comm = MPI . COMM_WORLD # ------------------------- sample input --------------------------- dems_json_file = './Inputs/DEMs/dems.json' # specifying files for all DEM tiles thalweg_shp_fname = './Inputs/Shapefiles/LA_local.shp' output_dir = './Outputs/' + f ' { os . path . basename ( thalweg_shp_fname ) . split ( \".\" )[ 0 ] } _ { comm . Get_size () } -core/' # ------------------------- end input section --------------------------- river_map_mpi_driver ( dems_json_file = dems_json_file , thalweg_shp_fname = thalweg_shp_fname , output_dir = output_dir , comm = comm ) In stead of specifying a file list for the DEM tiles as in the serial example, the first argument takes a *.json file that specifies multiple sets of DEMs, for example: { \"CuDEM\" : { \"name\" : \"CuDEM\" , \"glob_pattern\" : \"./Inputs/DEMs/CuDEM/*.tif\" , \"file_list\" : [], \"boxes\" : [] }, \"CRM\" : { \"name\" : \"CRM\" , \"glob_pattern\" : \"./Inputs/DEMs/CRM/*.tif\" , \"file_list\" : [], \"boxes\" : [] } } Note For each DEM source, specify a glob pattern and/or a list of file names; if both are specified, the script will pool all files together and take the unique files. No need to manually specify the bounding \"boxes\", just leave them empty. Different DEM products should be arranged from high priority to low priority. The order of the dictionary key (\"CuDEM\" and \"CRM\") is preserved as long as you are using Python 3.7 or a later version. We may replace the regular dictionary to OrderedDict if there is a need. Under the directory \"RiverMapper_Samples/Parallel/\", execute the parallel script like this: mpirun -n 20 ./sample_parallel.py The exact mpi command may vary based on your system. Advanced Parameterization \u00b6 Mandatory input parameters \u00b6 In the \"Serial\" and \"Parallel\" examples above, you may have noticed there are 3 mandatory Inputs: parameter explanation tif_fnames (or a *.json file if there are many tiles) a list of TIF file names. These TIFs should cover the area of interest and be arranged by priority (higher priority ones in front) thalweg_shp_fname name of a polyline shapefile containing the thalwegs output_dir must specify one. Optional input parameters \u00b6 In addition to the mandatory inpouts, RiverMapper provides a few parameters to fine tune the output polylines or generate special features like levees or pseudo-channels. parameter type explanation selected_thalweg integer numpy array Indices of a subset of thalwegs for which the river arcs will be sought; mainly used by the parallel driver output_prefix string a prefix of the output files, mainly used by the caller of this script; can be empty mpi_print_prefix string a prefix string to identify the calling mpi processe in the output messages; can be empty river_threshold float minimum and maximum river widths (in meters) to be resolved min_arcs integer minimum number of arcs to resolve a channel (including bank arcs, inner arcs and outer arcs) width2narcs_option string or callable pre-defined options ('regular', 'sensitive', 'insensitve') or 'custom' if a user-defined function is specified custom_width2narcs a user-defined function a function that takes one parameter 'width' and returns 'narcs', i.e., the number of arcs in the cross-channel direction elev_scale float scaling factor for elevations; a number of -1 (invert elevations) is useful for finding ridges (e.g., of a barrier island) outer_arc_positions a tuple of floats relative position of outer arcs, e.g., (0.1, 0.2) will add 2 outer arcs on each side of the river (4 in total), 0.1 * riverwidth and 0.2 * riverwidth from the banks. R_coef float coef controlling the along-channel resolutions at river bends (with a radius of R), a larger number leads to coarser resolutions (R*R_coef) length_width_ratio float the ratio between along-channel resolution and cross-channel resolution along_channel_reso_thres a tuple of 2 floats the minimum and maximum along-channel resolution (in meters) snap_point_reso_ratio float scaling the threshold of the point snapping; a negtive number means absolute distance value snap_arc_reso_ratio float scaling the threshold of the arc snapping; a negtive number means absolute distance value n_clean_iter int number of iterations for cleaning; more iterations produce cleaner intersections and better channel connectivity i_close_poly bool whether to add cross-channel arcs to enclose river arcs into a polygon i_smooth_banks bool whether to smooth the river banks at abrupt changes of the curvature i_DEM_cache bool Whether or not to read DEM info from cache. Reading from original *.tif files can be slow, so the default option is True i_OCSMesh bool Whether or not to generate polygon-based outputs to be used as inputs to OCSMesh i_DiagnosticsOutput bool whether to output diagnostic information i_pseudo_channel int 0: default, no pseudo channel, nrow_pseudo_channel and pseudo_channel_width are ignored; 1: fixed-width channel with nrow elements in the cross-channel direction, it can also be used to generate a fixed-width levee for a given levee centerline; 2: implement a pseudo channel when the river is poorly defined in DEM pseudo_channel_width float width of the pseudo channel (in meters) nrow_pseudo_channel int number of rows of elements in the cross-channel direction in the pseudo channel You can change the values of these parameters so that the output river map better fits your application (otherwise default values are used). For example, if you want to add two pairs of outer arcs that flank the main river channel, you can do: make_river_map ( tif_fnames = [ './Inputs/DEMs/GA_dem_merged_ll.tif' ], thalweg_shp_fname = './Inputs/Shapefiles/GA_local.shp' , output_dir = './Outputs/' , outer_arc_positions = ( 0.1 , 0.2 ), ) , where the last argument specifies the relative distances of the outer arcs to the main channel. In this case two outer arcs will be placed to the left of the channel at distances of \" \\(0.1 \\times\\) channel width\" and \" \\(0.2 \\times\\) channel width\" from the left bank; the same goes for the right bank, so 4 outer arcs in total. Parameter presets \u00b6 Tuning the parameters may not be easy at first because there are many of them. To simplify the parameter configuration, RiverMapper offers a class called \"ConfigRiverMap\", which provides commonly used parameter presets. These presets are \"class methods\" in config_river_map.py , and each preset (class method, or factory method) comes with a short description in the code. For example, the preset \"LooselyFollowRivers\" means that \"Small-scale river curvatures may not be exactly followed, but channel connectivity is still preserved\", and this is the sample code: from RiverMapper.config_river_map import ConfigRiverMap river_map_config = ConfigRiverMap . LooselyFollowRivers () make_river_map ( tif_fnames = [ './Inputs/DEMs/GA_dem_merged_ll.tif' ], thalweg_shp_fname = './Inputs/Shapefiles/GA_local.shp' , output_dir = './Outputs/' , ** river_map_config . optional , ) and the operator \"**\" unpacks the optional parameters from the configuration. Another utility of the \"ConfigRiverMap\" class is to facilitate the parameter transfer from the parallel driver to the core routine. The stardard way of setting the parameters in the parallel mode is as follows: from mpi4py import MPI import os from RiverMapper.river_map_mpi_driver import river_map_mpi_driver from RiverMapper.config_river_map import ConfigRiverMap if __name__ == \"__main__\" : comm = MPI . COMM_WORLD # ------------------------- sample input --------------------------- dems_json_file = '/sciclone/schism10/Hgrid_projects/STOFS3D-V6/v16/Inputs/dems.json' # specifying files for all DEM tiles thalweg_shp_fname = '/sciclone/schism10/Hgrid_projects/STOFS3D-V6/v16/Shapefiles/CUDEM_Merged_for_v16.shp' output_dir = './Outputs/' + f ' { os . path . basename ( thalweg_shp_fname ) . split ( \".\" )[ 0 ] } _ { comm . Get_size () } -core/' river_map_config = ConfigRiverMap () # ------------------------- end input section --------------------------- river_map_mpi_driver ( dems_json_file = dems_json_file , thalweg_shp_fname = thalweg_shp_fname , output_dir = output_dir , river_map_config = river_map_config , comm = comm ) Comparing with the parallel example in the previous section, the above example adds a few lines of code that does the following: importing the \"ConfigRiverMap\" class creating a default configuration \"river_map_config\", passing the configration to the parallel driver. Since the default configuration is used, this example is essentially the same as the previous parallel example. But it facilitates further parameter tweaking, e.g.: river_map_config = ConfigRiverMap . LooselyFollowRivers () river_map_config . optional [ 'outer_arc_positions' ] = ( 0.1 , 0.2 ) river_map_config . optional [ 'i_real_clean' ] = True , without changing other parts of the code. More parameterization \u00b6 By tweaking the parameters, RiverMapper can also aid in the meshing of a wider range of river sizes or other channel-like features. Hudson River and tributaries \u00b6 This example shows how to customize cross-channel divisions for a main channel that is a few kilometers wide and smaller tributaries. from mpi4py import MPI import os from RiverMapper.river_map_mpi_driver import river_map_mpi_driver from RiverMapper.config_river_map import ConfigRiverMap if __name__ == \"__main__\" : comm = MPI . COMM_WORLD # ------------------------- sample input --------------------------- dems_json_file = '/sciclone/schism10/Hgrid_projects/Shared_with_KM/Inputs/dems.json' # specifying files for all DEM tiles thalweg_shp_fname = '/sciclone/schism10/Hgrid_projects/Shared_with_KM/Inputs/Thalwegs/thalweg_v16_subset_Hudson2.shp' output_dir = './Outputs/' + f ' { os . path . basename ( thalweg_shp_fname ) . split ( \".\" )[ 0 ] } _ { comm . Get_size () } -core/' river_map_config = ConfigRiverMap () # initialize a default configuration river_map_config . optional [ 'river_threshold' ] = ( 2 , 5000 ) # change the search range of river banks to accomodate for Hudson River river_map_config . optional [ 'along_channel_reso_thres' ] = ( 5 , 1200 ) # change the maximum element length from 300 (default for small rivers) to 1200 river_map_config . optional [ 'length_width_ratio' ] = 4.0 # set element aspect ratio as needed # Customize a width-to-narcs function and pass it to the configuration. def width2narcs ( width ): # do not change this line even if width is not used narcs = 5 # you can specify more sophisticated configurations here as needed return narcs # narcs is the number of rows in the cross-channel direction. # pass the customized function to the configuration river_map_config . optional [ 'custom_width2narcs' ] = width2narcs # ------------------------- end input section --------------------------- river_map_mpi_driver ( dems_json_file = dems_json_file , thalweg_shp_fname = thalweg_shp_fname , output_dir = output_dir , river_map_config = river_map_config , comm = comm ) The above code adds more customization to the parallel example. Please read the comments which explain each piece of customization. In particular, note how to pass a customized width-to-narcs function to the configuration. This function takes the width of a river and returns the number of rows in the cross-channel directions. Note The option 'river_threshold' specifies the min and max river width to be resolved, which affects the search range of river banks. A large value like 5000 m used here can slow down the execution compared to the default value (600 m, for small watershed rivers). In the future, we will allow users to select rivers and specify different values for this option. Here, a simplest function is used that specifies five rows of arcs regardless of river width, and the result is shown below: Of course you can specify more sophisticated functions depending on your needs, e.g., nrow = int ( min_arcs + np . ceil ( width / 100 )) # add one arc for every increase of 100 m or nrow = int ( min_arcs + np . floor ( 0.35 * width ** 0.25 )) # add one arc for every increase of one order of magnitude or even make a master plan (similar to the master grid for SCHISM's vgrid ) of how many arcs should be used for a given river width. Levees \u00b6 In the STOFS-3D-Atlantic domain, levees are important features to be incorporated in the model mesh. Instead of parameterizing them as hydraulic structures, the levees are explicitly represented by meter-scale elements, with two rows of nodes resolving the feet of the levee and another two rows resolving the top of the levee: With the levee centerlines available from National Levee Database, the levee map can be easily made by invoking the pseudo channel option of RiverMapper: river_map_config = ConfigRiverMap . Levees () Notice that the along-channel (in this case along-levee) resolution also adapts for bends, just like for rivers. Barrier islands \u00b6 Barrier islands are long and narrow topographical features similar to river channels. In fact, the map of a barrier island can be made in the same way as river channels if the sign of the DEM's elevation values is inverted. This can be done by setting the optional parameter \"elev_scale\" to \"-1\", or directly invoking the preset \"BarrierIsland\": river_map_config = ConfigRiverMap . BarrierIsland () Note The above two sample applications can also be found in RiverMapper_Samples.tar Experimental Features \u00b6 Global arc cleaning \u00b6 The experimental option \"i_real_clean\" has been removed from the parameter list, because it has superseded all other options for river confluence cleaning. It is the only cleaning option in the latest code and enabled by default. The idea is simple: arc vertices that are too close to any vertex or arc segment are snapped to the closest vertices. A critical step is defining how close is close. Setting a global threshold value would not work well because a larger value tends to over-simplify small rivers thus not ensuring channel connectivity and a smaller value causes insufficient cleaning for larger rivers. As a result, a spatially varying threshold is specified for each vertex based on the cross-channel resolution at that location. This ensures a sufficent level of cleaning while maintaining channel connectivity. For example, the resolution around a confluence is largely determined by the smallest branch: For a continental application like STOFS-3D-Atlantic that includes about 30,000 rivers, the cleaning takes about 10 minutes. Since the algorithm is fairly efficient, several iterations of cleaning are implemented allowing the threshold gradually increasing from a small value to the target value; in other words, the most close-by vertices are snapped first, which prevents overly aggressive snapping and slightly improve the quality of the end product. Outputs for OCSMesh \u00b6 The \"i_OCSMesh\" option leads to an extra shapefile output containing river polygons, which serves as an input to OCSMesh . The option is enabled by default because the polygon-based output may be useful for other mesh generators too. Outputting river mesh elements \u00b6 It may be desirable in some circumstances to directly discretize river polygons into elements (quadrangles and triangles). However, this is not the intended function of the tool at least by its original design but rather a task for mesh generators. In addition, the accuracy and efficiency of SCHISM are not sensitive to how mesh generators decide to form the elements (as quads or triangles), as long as they adhere to the given river arcs or polygons. We can implement this option if there is a need.","title":"Generate river map"},{"location":"mesh-generation/meshing-for-compound-floods/generate-river-map.html#scripts","text":"RiverMapper is available from the RiverMeshTools repository under schism-dev.","title":"Scripts"},{"location":"mesh-generation/meshing-for-compound-floods/generate-river-map.html#usage","text":"RiverMapper requires two inputs: *.tif, which are DEM tiles in lon/lat from one or more sources. a shapefile with a 'LineString' type, which contains a 1D river network.

To simplify the parameter configuration, RiverMapper offers a class called \"ConfigRiverMap\", which provides commonly used parameter presets. These presets are \"class methods\" in config_river_map.py , and each preset (class method, or factory method) comes with a short description in the code. For example, the preset \"LooselyFollowRivers\" means that \"Small-scale river curvatures may not be exactly followed, but channel connectivity is still preserved\", and this is the sample code: from RiverMapper.config_river_map import ConfigRiverMap river_map_config = ConfigRiverMap . LooselyFollowRivers () make_river_map ( tif_fnames = [ './Inputs/DEMs/GA_dem_merged_ll.tif' ], thalweg_shp_fname = './Inputs/Shapefiles/GA_local.shp' , output_dir = './Outputs/' , ** river_map_config . optional , ) and the operator \"**\" unpacks the optional parameters from the configuration. Another utility of the \"ConfigRiverMap\" class is to facilitate the parameter transfer from the parallel driver to the core routine. The stardard way of setting the parameters in the parallel mode is as follows: from mpi4py import MPI import os from RiverMapper.river_map_mpi_driver import river_map_mpi_driver from RiverMapper.config_river_map import ConfigRiverMap if __name__ == \"__main__\" : comm = MPI .

This function takes the width of a river and returns the number of rows in the cross-channel directions. Note The option 'river_threshold' specifies the min and max river width to be resolved, which affects the search range of river banks. A large value like 5000 m used here can slow down the execution compared to the default value (600 m, for small watershed rivers). In the future, we will allow users to select rivers and specify different values for this option. Here, a simplest function is used that specifies five rows of arcs regardless of river width, and the result is shown below: Of course you can specify more sophisticated functions depending on your needs, e.g., nrow = int ( min_arcs + np . ceil ( width / 100 )) # add one arc for every increase of 100 m or nrow = int ( min_arcs + np . floor ( 0.35 * width ** 0.25 )) # add one arc for every increase of one order of magnitude or even make a master plan (similar to the master grid for SCHISM's vgrid ) of how many arcs should be used for a given river width.","title":"Hudson River and tributaries"},{"location":"mesh-generation/meshing-for-compound-floods/generate-river-map.html#levees","text":"In the STOFS-3D-Atlantic domain, levees are important features to be incorporated in the model mesh.

It is the only cleaning option in the latest code and enabled by default. The idea is simple: arc vertices that are too close to any vertex or arc segment are snapped to the closest vertices. A critical step is defining how close is close. Setting a global threshold value would not work well because a larger value tends to over-simplify small rivers thus not ensuring channel connectivity and a smaller value causes insufficient cleaning for larger rivers. As a result, a spatially varying threshold is specified for each vertex based on the cross-channel resolution at that location. This ensures a sufficent level of cleaning while maintaining channel connectivity. For example, the resolution around a confluence is largely determined by the smallest branch: For a continental application like STOFS-3D-Atlantic that includes about 30,000 rivers, the cleaning takes about 10 minutes. Since the algorithm is fairly efficient, several iterations of cleaning are implemented allowing the threshold gradually increasing from a small value to the target value; in other words, the most close-by vertices are snapped first, which prevents overly aggressive snapping and slightly improve the quality of the end product.","title":"Global arc cleaning"},{"location":"mesh-generation/meshing-for-compound-floods/generate-river-map.html#outputs-for-ocsmesh","text":"The \"i_OCSMesh\" option leads to an extra shapefile output containing river polygons, which serves as an input to OCSMesh .

These examples use SMS to merge the automatic arcs with existing manual arcs and generate the final mesh. The projects are organized in order of increasing complexity. Note The main purpose is to illustrate the necessary steps to get a clean map coverage for meshing, and you're welcome to employ any tools or methods that suit your preference. The key is to organize different map features (such as coastal water bodies, watershed rivers, hydraulic structures) in individual SMS map coverages and merge them properly to avoid unwanted intersections. Calcasieu Lake \u00b6 The first example illustrates how you may extend an existing coastal model mesh to include higher-grounds and small rivers in the watershed. Step 1. Start from an existing map coverage. Assume you have a manually made SMS map for a traditional coastal simulation like this: The spatial domain (orange color) covers everything below the sea level in the study area. Step 2. Include more upland areas of interest: Define a boundary that delineates the landward limit of the new domain of interest, for example: Step 3. Clip the automatic arcs so that they are only present in the areas of interest. Typically, we want to put the automatic arcs (watershed rivers) only in the extended region. This can be done in various ways, e.g., using GIS tools or scripts. For this simple project, using SMS or GIS tools is straightforward, and here is an example using the clipping tool (similar to that in ArcGIS or QGIS) inside SMS: Duplicate the full domain map coverage (from Step 2) and name it as \"extended\" Select the polygon that corresponds to the extended region, remove other polygons by invert selection and delete: Use the clipping tool in the toolbox, and clip the automatic arcs inside the extended region. The results look like: Step 4. Merge the clipped automatic arcs and generate the mesh. Note If you want to set a uniform mesh resolution in the extended region, you should do it before merging, because the polygon of the extended region will be split into many parts afterwards, making it labor intensive to set attributes for them manually. Set the element size as: After merging, you should clean the final coverage and build polygons again. The element size set in the extended region will be inherited (as of SMS 13.3.5) even though it has been split into many parts by river arcs: Note Sometimes a few parts split from the original extended region may not inherit the polygon attributes and default to \"paving\", in this case you may need to manually set the polygon attributes or design another map coverage to facilitate the selection. This is elaborated below . And here is the final mesh: Coastal areas in Texas \u00b6 This example is similar to the first one, but the existing map is more complex. Step 1. Start from an existing map coverage. This manual map consists of many polygons and some of them are islands (empty polygons, not meshed). Step 2. Include more upland areas of interest: Include islands of interest. For example, the yellow polygons in the figure above are islands, which have a mesh type of \"None\". Set them to \"Paving\" so that they will be meshed. If many islands need to be set to \"paving\" in the existing map coverage, you can directly edit the *.map file and replace all occurrences of the string \"NOMESH\" to \"PAVE 0.3\". Define a boundary that delineates the landward limit of the new domain, for example: Step 3. Clip the automatic arcs so that they are only present in the areas of interest. Similar to the first example, the extended region is the difference between the newly defined full domain and the original domain (which also includes any islands of interest): The clipped arcs look like: Depending on your needs, you may want the automatic arcs to intersect with the existing arcs (set buffer=0 in this case) or leave a buffer distance between the two groups of arcs. We typically don't let automatic arcs intersect with existing arcs, but this requires some further considerations (see below ) to ensure channel connectivity. Here, we provide an example using Python scripting: Merge the newly defined the land boundary with the existing coverage: , clean the merged coverage and rebuild polygons in SMS. Save the original coverage and the merged coverage (full domain) as polygon shapefiles. Use the Python script below to clip the automatic arcs: import geopandas as gpd # ------------------------- inputs --------------------------- wdir = '/sciclone/schism10/Hgrid_projects/GoM/' original = gpd . read_file ( f ' { wdir } /original.shp' ) full_domain = gpd . read_file ( f ' { wdir } /full.shp' ) islands = gpd . read_file ( f ' { wdir } /islands.shp' ) buffer_distance = 50e-5 # set to 0 if no buffer is needed # ------------------------- end inputs --------------------------- # buffer the original domain so that the clipped arcs don't intersect with the original domain original_buf = gpd . GeoDataFrame ( geometry = original . buffer ( buffer_distance )) # the extended region is the \"watershed\" region where the auto arcs are placed extended_region = full_domain . overlay ( original_buf , how = 'difference' ) . dissolve () # add any islands back islands_buf = gpd . GeoDataFrame ( geometry = islands . buffer ( - buffer_distance )) # \"minus\" because we want the river arcs contained in the islands extended_region = extended_region . append ( islands_buf ) # clip the auto arcs to the extended region total_arcs = gpd . read_file ( f ' { wdir } /total_arcs.shp' ) total_arcs_clipped = total_arcs . clip ( extended_region ) total_arcs_clipped . to_file ( f ' { wdir } /total_arcs_clipped.shp' ) The usage of this simple script is self-evident and you can use it as a starting point for your own project. Scripting is recommended for more complex projects with many individual map coverages. Step 4. Merge the clipped automatic arcs and generate the mesh. See details in the SECOFS example. SECOFS (South-east Coastal Forecast System) \u00b6 This example is based on the SECOFS domain. This project has an additional component in the map module, i.e., the levee and dam system from the National Levee Database. In a more complex project like this one, it is recommended to use a script to clip the automatic arcs inside the extended (watershed) region. The SCHISM Git repo provides a clipping script for SECOFS: $your_schism_dir /src/Utility/Pre-Processing/SECOFS/Grid/clip_autoarcs.py This script is similar to the one shown in the Texas example above, but it has more steps. The rest of the procedures of automatic arcs preperation is similar to what have been shown in the previous examples and not repeated here. Preparation \u00b6 The SECOFS SMS project has the following components: For a complex meshing project, it is imperative to keep different features in seperate maps. Merging individual maps should be done as the last step. In this project, the purpose of each SMS map coverage is as follows: lbnd: land boundary roughly along the 10-m contour. levee*: Levees from National Levee Database. auto*arcs: Automatically generated river arcs, clipped inside the watershed region (see clipping the river arcs ) coast: This map includes all manually made polygons (including quad patches) and the coastline. merge coverge: Merged map of all individual maps above. Attention Never edit the merged map directly, unless you are willing to take the time to exactly reproduce the changes in all individual maps (which is more time consuming in most cases, so don't do it). For a complex project, breaking the consistency between the merged map and the individual maps makes it practically impossible for any significant changes in the future. Clean the merged map \u00b6 Since SMS 13.3, the cleaning is very efficient even for a map with tens of thousands of arcs. However, you may need to clean the merged map multiple times until there is no more warning messages. For STOFS3D or SECOFS, use with the following parameters: Build polygons \u00b6 Make sure there is no warning message after the polygons are built; otherwise, go back to the cleaning step and try again. Finalize the mesh \u00b6 Delete the disjoint nodes: Renumber nodes: Save the mesh as *.2dm: ** Mesh quality and skew elements ** \u00b6 Although the script tries to optimize the convergence of river arcs at river intersections , skew elements may occasionally occur. Normally these small 'bad' elements do not affect the efficiency or stability of SCHISM simulations. However, it's advisable to edit out extremely small/skew elements. You may remedy them using the following script provided in RiverMapper : RiverMeshTools/RiverMapper/RiverMapper/improve_hgrid.py The script automatically checks for small and skew elements, then improve the mesh by merging, removing, or relaxing the problematic elements. As a general rule of thumb, SCHISM can comfortably handle elements >= \\(1m^2\\) ( \\(10^{-10}\\) in lon/lat), and skewness<=60. You can specify these parameters in the script; see the \" main \" section of the script for usage. Alternatively, you can use ACE/xmgredit5 or SMS to check and fix mesh quality manually. Attention Avoid overly depending on mesh adjustments in the final stage, as the underlying issue often originates from the SMS coverages or the merging process. In these instances, it is best to address the problems directly within the SMS coverages. Additional notes for STOFS/SECOFS developers \u00b6 These notes are primarily intended as a reference for developers, although other users might also find parts of the content beneficial. Strategy for editing the coastal coverage \u00b6 Edit the coastal coverage when local refinements are needed in an area of interest. Rules to follow (for consistency among STOFS3D/SECOFS developers): The manual arcs should at least be better than the auto arcs; use the shapefile of the auto arcs as a background in SMS to help you decide. In particular, this means you need to accommodate for tributaries when placing a manual polygon for a main channel, lake, or estuary: No need to create buffers for manual polygons; the clipping procedure automatically creates a 50-meter buffer zone around all manual polygons. Attention Arcs not included in a polygon do not have a buffer; this setting is intentional. Unless you have a clear plan, don't mix features from other coverages (e.g., levees and auto arcs) in the coastal coverage, which is reserved for manual editing. Doing so means that you assume the responsiblity of keeping the manual edits up-to-date with external changes that may be more easily done in other coverages. For example, the National Levee Database add/remove features from time to time; the requirements on the auto arcs may change or there may be improvements in the RiverMapper tool itself. In addition, putting auto arcs in this coverage means that you will spend extra time trying to satisfy the first rule of explicitly accommodating for the connectivity with tributaries. Set watershed resolution \u00b6 To avoid over-refinement, most watershed polygons should have a specified mesh resolution, which can be set via the \"constant paving\" or \"scalar paving density\" option in each polygon's attributes. Selecting the watershed polygons may involve much labor because many small polygons are generated after the river arcs are merged into the final map. Instead of manual selection, use the \"select*\" map coverage to select all polygons more efficiently. Activate the \"select*\" coverage: Select the big polygon, right click on it, and click \"Select intersecting objects\": Intersect it with \"merge coverage\" with the following parameters: It will take about 10 minutes to do the selection for the STOFS3D domain. For STOFS3D, right click on the selected polygons and set \"mesh type\" in \"polygon attributes\" to scalar paving density: Set scalar options using the watershed_resolution scatter dataset from the preparation step: In addition, set the polygon attribute of the \"island\" between Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay as \"None\": For SECOFS, \"Constant paving\" with the following parameters is used:","title":"Meshing in SMS"},{"location":"mesh-generation/meshing-for-compound-floods/meshing-in-SMS.html#overview","text":"Here we provide three sample projects to illustrate the procedure of meshing for compound flood simulations.

As a general rule of thumb, SCHISM can comfortably handle elements >= \\(1m^2\\) ( \\(10^{-10}\\) in lon/lat), and skewness<=60. You can specify these parameters in the script; see the \" main \" section of the script for usage. Alternatively, you can use ACE/xmgredit5 or SMS to check and fix mesh quality manually.

Rules to follow (for consistency among STOFS3D/SECOFS developers): The manual arcs should at least be better than the auto arcs; use the shapefile of the auto arcs as a background in SMS to help you decide. In particular, this means you need to accommodate for tributaries when placing a manual polygon for a main channel, lake, or estuary: No need to create buffers for manual polygons; the clipping procedure automatically creates a 50-meter buffer zone around all manual polygons. Attention Arcs not included in a polygon do not have a buffer; this setting is intentional. Unless you have a clear plan, don't mix features from other coverages (e.g., levees and auto arcs) in the coastal coverage, which is reserved for manual editing. Doing so means that you assume the responsiblity of keeping the manual edits up-to-date with external changes that may be more easily done in other coverages. For example, the National Levee Database add/remove features from time to time; the requirements on the auto arcs may change or there may be improvements in the RiverMapper tool itself. In addition, putting auto arcs in this coverage means that you will spend extra time trying to satisfy the first rule of explicitly accommodating for the connectivity with tributaries.","title":"Strategy for editing the coastal coverage"},{"location":"mesh-generation/meshing-for-compound-floods/meshing-in-SMS.html#set-watershed-resolution","text":"To avoid over-refinement, most watershed polygons should have a specified mesh resolution, which can be set via the \"constant paving\" or \"scalar paving density\" option in each polygon's attributes.

It is crucial to accurately and economically resolve the small rivers in the watershed to ensure hydraulic connectivity while minimizing the mesh size. Additionally, flood risk reduction structures such as levees and dams also need to be represented in the mesh. The mesh of STOFS3D has gone through major upgrades from STOFS3D v4 to v6, which serves as a good illustration of different meshing techniques: In the v4 mesh, small watershed rivers are resolved by a 1D representation, using 1D river segments from the National Water Model as feature arcs to guide the meshing. In the v5 mesh, characteristic contours of the DEM are extracted and used to represent river banks and thalwegs. However, extensive manual cleaning is required due to the potential messiness of these contours. In the v6 mesh, the river arcs are automatically generated by using pyDEM and RiverMapper , both of which are included in SCHISM's GitHub repo .

It is usually invoked together with SED (with optional morphological acceleration) and optionally with WWM; cf. Nunez et al. (2020) . The only parameter for this module is slr_rate (sea-level rise rate in mm/yr). The output flag is iof_marsh , which is an integer of either 0 (no marsh) or 1 (has marsh) at an element. Optionally, the user might also consider invoking the vegetation option in the code isav in conjunction with the marsh module to simulate the form drag and turbulence induced by the marsh vegetation.

SCHISM modules can be broadly divided into two categories: tracer and non-tracer modules. The main difference is that tracer modules share more infrastructure with the main hydro code base, e.g. using the transport solver, with I.C. and B.C.\u2019s that resemble those for the temperature and salinity, and sharing the source inputs ( msource.th ). Most modules also require additional inputs of their own (e.g. wwminput.nml for WWM). There are 12 tracer modules and they are (in order of appearance and precedence in bctides.in ; the names in brackets are used in input names; e.g. TEM_1.th etc) - Temperature [ TEM ] Salinity [ SAL ] Generic tracer [ GEN ]: generic tracer module with a settle velocity gen_wsett in param.nml ). The user can use this module as a template to add their own tracer behavior etc (by modifying the code sections bounded by USE_GEN ); AGE [ AGE ]: water age module of Delhez & Deleersnijder (2002) and Shen and Haas (2004); SED3D [ SED ]: 3D non-cohesive sediment transport module; EcoSim [ ECO ]: EcoSim of Paul Bissett; ICM [ ICM ]: USACE\u2019s water quality model of CE-QUAL-ICM CoSINE [ COS ]: Carbon, Silicate, Nitrogen Ecosystem model of Prof. Fei Chai (U. of Maine) Fecalbacteria [ FIB ]: fecal indicating bacteria model; TIMOR: not active at the moment FABM [ FBM ]: Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models, a flexible biogeochemical model framework; DVD [ DVD ]: numerical mixing analysis of Klingbeit et al. (2014) The B.C. flags for each invoked tracer module are specified in bctides.in . For example, if you invoked GEN (1 class), SED (1 class), and ICM (21 state variables inside), the boundary condition at an open segment may look like - 39 2 0 3 4 1 2 2 ![# of nodes], elev, vel, T,S, GEN, SED, ICM 0.5 !constant elev 0.1 !relax for T 0.1 !relax for S 0.5 !relax for GEN 0. !constant SED concentration 1.e-3 !relax for SED 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. !ICM concentrations 1.e-3 !relax for ICM [next segment...] And in addition, you\u2019ll need to prepare inputs: SAL_3D.th.nc and GEN_*.th . Similarly, msource.th should also include the tracer concentrations for all invoked modules; for the example shown above, a line in the msource.th should look like this (assuming 2 sources in source_sink.in): 86400. 10. 10. 0. 0. -9999. -9999. 0. 0. -9999. ...-9999. !time (sec), T, S, GEN, SED, ICM <-------------> 21x2 values for ICM For some tracer modules the user also needs to specify number of tracer classes inside the module in param.nml : ntracer_gen = 2 !user defined module (USE_GEN) ntracer_age = 4 !age calculation (USE_AGE). Must be =2*N where N is # of age tracers sed_class = 5 !SED3D (USE_SED) eco_class = 27 !EcoSim The output flags for all modules are iof_[name] , where name is the lower case of the module name; e.g. iof_wwm() . See the sample param.nml for a complete list of output flags as well as the variable names that appear in the netcdf outputs.

The main parameters are set in particle.bp . Below is a sample: 1 !screen outputs 0 !mod_part (0: passive; 1: oil spill) 1 !ibf (forward (=1) or backward (=-1) tracking) 1 !istiff (1: fixed distance from free surface) 1 -124 46.25 !ics slam0 sfea0 (see param.nml) 0.1 8. 90. 10 960 9 ! h0, rnday, dt, nspool, ihfskip, ndeltp (same as param.nml except for the last one, which is # of sub-divisions within each step) 16 !# number of particles 1 84600. 385000 510000 -5. !particle id, start time (s), starting x,y, and z relative to the instant surface (<=0) 2 84610. 300000 450000 0. ... The main output is particle.pth , which uses the drogue format that can be visualized with ACE/xmvis6. Figure 1 shows an example.

The algorithm is implemented on UGs and we have also reworked several components and added a morphological module (Exner equation). Detailed are reported in Pinto et al. (2012) . Also note that for best results this module should be run in conjunction with the wave model (WWM) to account for the wave-enhanced bottom stress. The main parameter input is sediment.nml , which is a namelist file. The sample file has comments /explanations for each parameter; a few important ones are explained below: sed_morph : This parameter controls active morphology. Nbed : The # of bed layers affects the stability of the sorting, and Nbed=1 works robustly with sed_morph>0 . Other inputs include sed_class and output flags in param.nml , and a few .ic files: bedthick.ic , bed_frac_[1,2..].ic , and I.C. for concentrations of all classes ( *_[hvar]_[1,2\u2026].ic or ( *_[vvar]_[1,2\u2026].ic ). The B.C. inputs may include SED_[1,2..].th , SED_3D.th.nc . The nudging inputs may be SED_nudge.gr3 and SED_nu.nc . The outputs from SED3D can be combined and visualized just as other SCHISM outputs. A common crash occurs when the active morphology is on. At a river inflow boundary, often the depths will decrease over time due to deposition there and eventually the boundary will become dry/blocked. A work-around is to use a combination of \u2018bare-rock\u2019 bed around the boundary (specified in bedthick.ic ), and \u2018clear-water\u2019 inflow as B.C. (sediment concentration =0 in bctides.in ) , and then input the incoming sediment concentration as point sources ( msource.th ) a distance away from the boundary.

Here we use Cartesian coordinates for brevity, with \\(i, j = 1, 2\\) implying \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directions, and the implementation of spherical coordinates will be discussed further. Summation over repeating coordinate indices is implied. The stress tensor is symmetric. The mass \\(m\\) is the combination of ice and snow contributions \\[\\begin{equation} m=\\rho_{ice}h_{ice}+\\rho_sh_s \\end{equation}\\] with \\(\\rho_{ice}\\) and \\(\\rho_s\\) , respectively, the densities of ice and snow and \\(h_{ice}\\) and \\(h_s\\) their mean thicknesses (volumes per unit area). For the visco-plastic (VP) rheology (Hibler, 1979) one writes \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{ice02} \\sigma_{ij}=2\\eta (\\dot{\\epsilon}_{ij} -0.5 \\delta_{ij} \\dot{\\epsilon}_{kk}) + \\zeta \\delta_{ij} \\dot{\\epsilon}_{kk} -0.5\\delta_{ij} P \\end{equation}\\] where \\[\\begin{equation} \\dot{\\epsilon}_{ij}=0.5(\\partial u_i / \\partial x_j + \\partial u_j / \\partial x_i) \\end{equation}\\] is the deformation rate tensor, \\(\\eta\\) and \\(\\zeta\\) are the moduli (\u2018viscosities\u2019) and \\(P\\) the pressure. Both the stress and deformation rate tensors are symmetric, so they are characterized by three independent components. The standard VP rheology adopts the following scheme of computing pressure \\(P\\) and moduli \\(\\eta\\) and \\(\\zeta\\) : \\[\\begin{equation} P_0=h_{ice}p^* exp[-C(1-a)], P=P_0\\frac{\\Delta}{(\\Delta+\\Delta_{min}}, \\zeta=\\frac{0.5P_0}{\\Delta+\\Delta_{min}}, \\eta=\\frac{\\zeta}{e^2} \\end{equation}\\] \\(e=2\\) (the ellipticity parameter), \\(C=20\\) , \\(\\Delta_{min}=2.e-9 s^{-1}\\) , and \\(p^*=15000 Pa\\) are default values, they are adjusted in practice. In this scheme, \\(\\Delta_{min}\\) serves for viscous regularization of plastic behavior in areas where \\(\\Delta t\\) is very small. We note that recent multi-category ice implementations (such as CICE, see Hunke and Lipscomb 2008) use different parameterization for \\(P_0\\) , which takes into account the distribution of ice over thickness categories. This does not change the basic equations ( \\(\\ref{ice01}\\) , \\(\\ref{ice02}\\) ). In our case we deal with three tracers, the area coverage \\(a\\) , ice volume \\(h_{ice}\\) and snow volume \\(h_s\\) . They are advected with ice velocities and modified through thermodynamical forcing \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{ice03} \\partial_t a+\\nabla(a\\pmb{u})=S_a, \\partial_t h_{ice}+\\nabla(h_{ice}\\pmb{u})=S_{ice}, \\partial_t h_s+\\nabla(h_s\\pmb{u})=S_s \\end{equation}\\] with \\(S_a\\) , \\(S_{ice}\\) and \\(S_s\\) the sources due to the exchange with atmosphere and ocean. The system ( \\(\\ref{ice01}, \\ref{ice02}, \\ref{ice03}\\) ), augmented with appropriate model of sources and boundary conditions, defines the sea ice model. We use the boundary conditions of no slip for momentum and no flux for tracers at lateral walls. The well known difficulty in solving these equation is related to the rheology term in the momentum equation, which makes this equation very stiff and would require time steps of fractions of second if stepped explicitly. There are two ways of handling this difficulty. The first one treats the rheology part in an implicit way, with linearization for the moduli, as suggested by Zhang and Hibler (1997). As mentioned elsewhere (see, e. g., Lemieux and Tremblay, 2009), it does not warrant full convergence, which requires a full nonlinear solver (for example, a Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov one, see Lemieux et al. 2012). The latter is still too expensive computationally, so the VP option used by us is similar in spirit to that of Zhang and Hibler (see section 2.4). The second way is to reformulate the VP approach by adding pseudo-elasticity. It raises the time order of the system \\(\\ref{ice01}, \\ref{ice02}\\) to the second, which makes the CFL limitation on the explicit time step much less severe than in the original VP framework. Below is the formulation for a modified elastic-visco-plastic (mEVP) due to Bouillon et al. (2013). It can be considered as a pseudo-time solver for VP rheology. In this case one writes \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} \\alpha (\\sigma_1^{p+1} - \\sigma_1^{p})=\\frac{P_0}{\\Delta^p+\\Delta_{min}} (\\dot{\\epsilon}_1^p -\\Delta^p)-\\sigma_1^{p} \\\\ \\alpha (\\sigma_2^{p+1} - \\sigma_2^{p})=\\frac{P_0}{(\\Delta^p+\\Delta_{min})e^2} \\dot{\\epsilon}_2p -\\sigma_2^{p} \\\\ \\alpha (\\sigma_{12}^{p+1} - \\sigma_{12}^{p})=\\frac{P_0}{(\\Delta^p+\\Delta_{min})e^2} \\dot{\\epsilon}_{12}^p -\\sigma_{12}^{p} \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] for stresses and \\[\\begin{equation} \\beta(\\pmb{u}^{p+1}-\\pmb{u}^p)=-\\pmb{u}^{p+1}+\\pmb{u}^n-\\Delta t \\pmb{f}\\times \\pmb{u}^{p+1}+\\frac{\\Delta t}{m}[\\pmb{F}^{p+1}+a\\tau+C_da\\rho_o(\\pmb{u}_o^n-\\pmb{u}^{p+1})|\\pmb{u}_o^n-\\pmb{u}^p| -mg\\nabla H^n] \\end{equation}\\] for velocity. We define: \\[\\begin{equation} \\sigma_1=\\sigma_{11}+\\sigma_{22}, \\sigma_2=\\sigma_{11}-\\sigma_{22} \\end{equation}\\] and similarly for deformation: \\[\\begin{equation} \\dot{\\epsilon}_1=\\dot{\\epsilon}_{11}+\\dot{\\epsilon}_{22}, \\dot{\\epsilon}_2=\\dot{\\epsilon}_{11}-\\dot{\\epsilon}_{22} \\end{equation}\\] Here \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are some large constants. The subscript \\(p\\) is related to pseudotime iterations, replacing subcycling of the standard EVP, and \\(n\\) is the previous time step. Fields are initialized with values at time step \\(n\\) for \\(p = 1\\) , and their values for the last iteration \\(p = N_{EVP}\\) are taken as solutions for time step \\(n+ 1\\) . Clearly, if \\(N_{EVP}\\) is sufficiently large, the VP solutions have to be recovered. In order that CFL limitations be satisfied, the product \\(\\alpha\\beta\\) should be sufficiently large (see Bouillon et al. (2013)). The regime of the standard EVP scheme ( \\(N_{EVP} = 120\\) and \\(T_{EVP} = \\Delta t/3\\) ) will be approximately recovered for \\(\\alpha =\\beta = 40\\) and \\(N_{EVP} = 120\\) , but much larger values have to be used on fine meshes to warrant absence of noise. For this reason, in SCHISM we have added a new option where \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are functions of the mesh size: \\[\\begin{equation} \\alpha =\\beta=\\frac{C}{tanh(BA/\\Delta t_{ice})} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(A\\) is element area, \\(C\\) is the minimum, and \\(B\\) is an adjustable coefficient that controls how quickly \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) depart from their minimum, \\(\\Delta t_{ice}\\) is the time step used in the ice model. One expects that if this scheme is stable and converged, it should produce solutions identical to those of converging VP solver. In reality, it will not be run for full convergence, which is still too expensive, and some difference will be preserved. The sea-ice model described here implements the three approaches mentioned above, which will be referred further as VP, EVP and mEVP. The reason of keeping all them is two-fold. First, it facilitates the comparison of results with other models which may be using one of these approaches. Second, their numerical efficiency and performance depend on applications, and one may wish to select the most appropriate approach. The tracer transport equation ( \\(\\ref{ice03}\\) ) is solved using a FCT scheme. Usage \u00b6 Compile with USE_ICE on; The time step for this moule is controlled by nstep_ice in param.nml . In addition, the output handles are found in SCHOUT section. The code will compute the ice-ocean stress at cells covered by ice; The main parameter input for this module is ice.nml (you can find a sample in sample_inputs/ ), where you specify the ice thermodynamic constants etc. You can specify the new mEVP option with mevp_coef . Control dispersion/diffusion in transport by using the parameters in ice.nml and ice_fct.gr3 . This is important for very fine mesh size.

A Galerkin weighted residual statement in the weak form for Eq. \\(\\ref{eq01}\\) reads: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq04} \\int_\\Omega \\phi_i \\frac{\\eta^{n+1} - \\eta^{n}}{\\Delta t} d\\Omega + \\theta \\left[ -\\int_\\Omega \\nabla \\phi_i \\cdot \\pmb{U}^{n+1} d\\Omega + \\int_\\Gamma \\phi_i U_n^{n+1} d\\Gamma \\right] + (1-\\theta) \\left[ -\\int_\\Omega \\nabla \\phi_i \\cdot \\pmb{U}^{n} d\\Omega + \\int_\\Gamma \\phi_i U_n^n d\\Gamma \\right] = 0, (i = 1, ... , N_p) \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(N_p\\) is the total number of nodes, \\(\\Gamma \\equiv \\Gamma_\\nu + \\overline{\\Gamma}_\\nu\\) is the boundary of the entire domain \\(\\Omega\\) , with \\(\\Gamma_\\nu\\) corresponding to the boundary sagments where natural boundary conditions are specified, \\(\\pmb{U} = \\int_{-h}^{\\eta} \\pmb{u}dz\\) is the depth-integrated velocity, \\(U_n\\) is its normal component along the boundary, and \\(\\hat{U}_n\\) is the boundary condition. In SCHISM, linear shape functions are used (area coordinates for triangles and bi-linear function for quads); thus, \\(\\phi_i\\) are familier \"hat\" functions. Locally 2D case \u00b6 Since there is only one degree of freedom in the vertical dimention in this case, a straightforward integration of Eq. \\(\\ref{eq02}\\) gives - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq05} \\pmb{U}^{n+1} = \\check{\\pmb{G}} - g\\theta\\Delta t \\frac{H^2}{\\tilde{H}} \\nabla \\eta^{n+1} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(\\check{\\pmb{G}}\\) incorporates explicit term - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq06} \\check{\\pmb{G}} = \\frac{H}{\\tilde{H}}\\left[ \\pmb{U}^* + \\Delta t \\left( \\pmb{F} + \\pmb{\\tau}_w - g(1-\\theta)H\\nabla\\eta^n \\right) \\right] \\end{equation}\\] and \\(\\pmb{F}\\) is the depth integrated term of \\(\\pmb{f}\\) , and \\(\\tilde{H}\\) is the depth enhanced by the bottom friction and form drag - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq07} \\tilde{H} = H + \\left( \\chi + \\alpha \\left| \\pmb{u} \\right| H\\right)\\Delta t \\end{equation}\\] The net effect of the vegetation is therefore equivalent to increase in the bottom drag, since the 3D structure of the flow/vegetation is not accounted for. Substituting Eq. \\(\\ref{eq05}\\) into Eq. \\(\\ref{eq04}\\) results in an integral equation for the unknown \\(\\eta^{n+1}\\) alone. Locally 3D case \u00b6 We first integrate Eq. \\(\\ref{eq02}\\) from bottom to surface - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq08} \\frac{\\pmb{U}^{n+1}-\\pmb{U}^*}{\\Delta t} = \\pmb{F} - gH\\theta\\nabla\\eta^{n+1} - gH(1-\\theta)\\nabla\\eta^n + \\pmb{\\tau}_w - \\chi\\pmb{u}_b^{n+1} - \\alpha\\overline{\\left| \\pmb{u} \\right|} \\pmb{U}^{\\alpha} \\end{equation}\\] where we have performed linearization of the vegetation term - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq09} \\int_{-h}^{z_v} \\left|\\pmb{u}\\right|\\pmb{u}dz \\approx \\overline{\\left| \\pmb{u} \\right|} \\equiv \\overline{\\left| \\pmb{u} \\right|} \\pmb{U}^{\\alpha} , (\\text{where, }\\pmb{U}^{\\alpha} = \\int_{-h}^{z_v}\\pmb{u}dz) \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq10} \\overline{\\left| \\pmb{u} \\right|} = \\frac{1}{H^\\alpha} \\int_{-h}{z_v} \\left| \\pmb{u}^n \\right| dz \\end{equation}\\] and \\(H^\\alpha = z_v +h\\) is the height of vegetation. Note that similar procedures have been used for other nonlinear terms (e.g. the quadratic bottom drag). To eliminate \\(\\pmb{u}_b^{n+1}\\) in Eq \\(\\ref{eq08}\\) , we invoke the discretized momentum equation at the bottom cell and utilize the fact that the Reynolds stress is constant within the boundary layer, as shown in Zhang and Baptista (2008) - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq11} \\frac{\\pmb{u}_b^{n+1} - \\pmb{u}_b^*}{\\Delta t} = \\pmb{f}_b - g\\theta\\nabla\\eta^{n+1} - g(1-\\theta)\\nabla\\eta^n - \\alpha\\left|\\pmb{u}_b\\right|\\pmb{u}_b^{n+1} \\end{equation}\\] from which \\(\\pmb{u}_b^{n+1}\\) can be formally solved as - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq12} \\pmb{u}_b^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{1+\\alpha\\left|\\pmb{u}_b\\right|\\Delta t} \\left[\\pmb{u}_b^* +\\pmb{f}_b\\Delta t - g(1-\\theta)\\Delta t \\nabla \\eta^n \\right] - \\frac{g\\theta\\Delta t}{1+\\alpha\\left|\\pmb{u}_b\\right|\\Delta t}\\nabla\\eta^{n+1} \\end{equation}\\] The subscript \\(b\\) denotes the top of the bottom cell. Note that the main difference from the original formulation of Zhang and Baptista (2008) is the appearance of the vegetation term. The remaining task is to find \\(\\pmb{U}^\\alpha\\) . We\u2019ll discuss two scenarios of submerged and emergent vegetation. Emergent vegetation \u00b6 When the vegetation is locally emergent, i.e., \\(H^\\alpha \\geq H\\) , we have \\(\\pmb{U}^\\alpha = \\pmb{U}^{n+1}\\) , and therefore \\(\\pmb{U}^{n+1}\\) can be found from Eq. \\(\\ref{eq08}\\) and \\(\\ref{eq12}\\) as - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq13} \\pmb{U}^{n+1} = \\pmb{G}_1 - \\frac{g\\theta\\hat{H}\\Delta t}{1+\\alpha\\overline{\\left| \\pmb{u} \\right|} \\Delta t} \\nabla\\eta^{n+1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\pmb{G}_1\\) contains explicit terms - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq14} \\pmb{G}_1 = \\frac{\\pmb{U}^* + (\\pmb{F}+\\pmb{\\tau}_w)\\Delta t - g(1-\\theta)\\hat{H}\\Delta t \\nabla\\eta^n-\\tilde{\\chi}\\Delta t (\\pmb{u}_b^*+\\pmb{f}_b\\Delta t)}{1+\\alpha\\overline{\\left| \\pmb{u} \\right|} \\Delta t} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq15} \\tilde{\\chi} = \\frac{\\chi}{1+\\alpha \\left| \\pmb{u}_b \\right| \\Delta t} \\end{equation}\\] and \\(\\hat{H}\\) is a friction modified depth - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq16} \\hat{H} = H - \\tilde{\\chi}\\Delta t \\end{equation}\\] Compared to the original formulation in Zhang and Baptista (2008) , the only change in this depth is the vegetation term in \\(\\tilde{\\chi}\\) . Submerged vegetation \u00b6 When the vegetation is submerged, i.e., \\(H^\\alpha < H\\) , strong shear and turbulence develop between the vegetation and the overlying flow above it ( ST94 ). Nepf and Vivoni (2000) demonstrated that there are two zones for submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). In the upper canopy (called the \u2018vertical exchange zone\u2019), mean shear at the top of the canopy produces vertical turbulent exchange with the overlying water, which plays a significant role in the momentum balance. The lower canopy (\u2018longitudinal change zone\u2019 as in Nepf and Vivoni, 2000 ) communicates with surrounding water predominantly through longitudinal advection. The extent of the vertical exchange of momentum between the vegetation zone and overlying water is dependent on the submergence. We first integrate the momentum equation (Eq. \\(\\ref{eq02}\\) ) from the bottom to the top of canopy - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq17} \\pmb{U}^\\alpha = \\pmb{U}^{*\\alpha} + \\pmb{F}^\\alpha\\Delta t - g\\theta H^\\alpha \\Delta t \\nabla\\eta^{n+1} - g(1-\\theta)H^\\alpha\\Delta t \\nabla \\eta^n - \\alpha \\Delta t \\overline{\\left| \\pmb{u} \\right|} \\pmb{U}^\\alpha + \\Delta t\\nu \\Bigr\\rvert_{-h}^{z_v} \\end{equation}\\] where \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq18} \\begin{aligned} \\pmb{U}^{*\\alpha} = \\int_{-h}^{z_v}\\pmb{u}^* dz\\\\ \\pmb{F}^\\alpha = \\int_{-h}^{z_v}\\pmb{f}dz \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] The Reynolds stress at the top of canopy can be calculated from theory proposed by ST94. These authors found through lab experiments that the stress variation inside the vegetation layer approximately follows an exponential law \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq19} \\nu\\frac{\\partial\\pmb{u}}{\\partial z} \\equiv \\overline{u'w'} = \\pmb{R}_0 e^{\\beta_2 (z-z_v)} \\text{ for } z \\leq z_v \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\pmb{R}_0\\) is the stress at \\(z=z_v\\) , and \\(\\beta_2\\) is determined by an empirical formula - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq20} \\beta_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{N_v}}{H^\\alpha}} \\left[ -0.32 - 0.85 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{H - H^\\alpha}{H^\\alpha} I\\right) \\right] \\end{equation}\\] where \\(I\\) is an energy gradient - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq21} I = \\frac{\\chi \\left| \\pmb{u}_b \\right|}{gH} \\end{equation}\\] which is estimated from the previous time step in the model. The stress term in Eq. \\(\\ref{eq19}\\) therefore becomes \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq22} \\nu\\frac{\\partial\\pmb{u}}{\\partial z}\\Bigr\\rvert_{-h}^{z_v} = \\beta \\chi \\pmb{u}_b^{n+1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\beta = e^{\\beta_2(z_v - z_b)}-1\\) , and \\(z_b\\) is the location of the top of the bottom grid cell. Substituting Eq. \\(\\ref{eq22}\\) and Eq. \\(\\ref{eq12}\\) into Eq. \\(\\ref{eq17}\\) we can solve for \\(\\pmb{U}^\\alpha\\) as - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq23} \\pmb{U}^\\alpha = \\pmb{G}_3 - \\frac{g\\theta\\hat{H}^\\alpha\\Delta t}{1+\\alpha\\overline{\\left| \\pmb{u}\\right|}\\Delta t}\\nabla \\eta^{n+1} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq24} \\pmb{G}_3 = \\frac{\\pmb{U}^{*\\alpha}+\\pmb{F}^\\alpha\\Delta t + \\beta\\tilde{\\chi}\\Delta t(\\pmb{u}_b^* + \\pmb{f}_b\\Delta t) - g(1-\\theta)\\hat{H}^\\alpha\\Delta t \\nabla \\eta^n}{1+\\alpha\\overline{\\left| \\pmb{u} \\right|}\\Delta t} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq25} \\hat{H}^\\alpha = H^\\alpha + \\beta\\tilde{\\chi}\\Delta t \\end{equation}\\] Finally, substituting Eq. \\(\\ref{eq23}\\) and Eq. \\(\\ref{eq12}\\) into Eq. \\(\\ref{eq08}\\) results in a relationship between \\(\\pmb{U}^{n+1}\\) and \\(\\eta^{n+1}\\) - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq26} \\pmb{U}^{n+1} = \\pmb{G}_2 - g\\theta\\overline{\\overline{H}}\\Delta t \\nabla \\eta^{n+1} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq27} \\overline{\\overline{H}} = H - \\tilde{\\chi}\\Delta t - c\\hat{H}^\\alpha \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq28} c = \\frac{\\alpha\\overline{\\left| \\pmb{u} \\right|}\\Delta t}{1 + \\alpha\\overline{\\left| \\pmb{u} \\right|}\\Delta t} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq29} \\pmb{G}_2 = \\pmb{U}^* - c\\pmb{U}^{*\\alpha} + (\\pmb{F} + \\pmb{\\tau_w})\\Delta t - c\\pmb{F}^\\alpha\\Delta t - \\tilde{\\chi}\\Delta t(1+\\beta c)(\\pmb{u}_b^*+\\pmb{f}_b\\Delta t) - g(1-\\theta)\\overline{\\overline{H}}\\Delta t \\nabla\\eta^n \\end{equation}\\] General case \u00b6 In summary, the depth-integrated velocity can be expressed in compact form as - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq30} \\pmb{U}^{n+1} = \\pmb{E} - g\\theta\\breve{H}\\Delta t\\nabla\\eta^{n+1} \\end{equation}\\] where, \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq31} \\begin{aligned} \\breve{H} = \\begin{cases} \\frac{H^2}{\\breve{H}}, \\text{ 2D }\\\\ \\frac{\\hat{H}}{1+\\alpha\\overline{\\left| \\pmb{u} \\right|}\\Delta t}, \\text{ 3D emergent }\\\\ \\overline{\\overline{H}}, \\text{ 3D submerged } \\end{cases} \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq32} \\begin{aligned} \\pmb{E} = \\begin{cases} \\breve{\\pmb{G}}, \\text{ 2D }\\\\ \\pmb{G}_1, \\text{ 3D emergent }\\\\ \\pmb{G}_2, \\text{ 3D submerged } \\end{cases} \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] Substituting Eq. \\(\\ref{eq30}\\) back into Eq. \\(\\ref{eq04}\\) gives an equation for the unknown elevations alone - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq33} I_1 = I_4 - \\theta\\Delta t I_3 - (1-\\theta)\\Delta t I_5 - \\theta\\Delta t I_6 \\text{, for } i=1, \\cdots, N_p \\end{equation}\\] where, \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq34} I_1 = \\int_\\Omega \\left[ \\phi_i \\eta^{n+1} + g\\theta^2\\Delta t^2\\ \\check{H}\\nabla\\phi_i\\cdot\\nabla\\eta^{n+1}\\right]d\\Omega \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq35} I_4 = \\int_\\Omega \\left[ \\phi_i\\eta^n + \\theta\\Delta t \\nabla\\phi_i\\cdot\\pmb{E} + (1-\\theta)\\Delta t \\nabla\\phi_i \\cdot\\pmb{U}^n \\right]d\\Omega \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq36} I_3 = \\int_{\\Gamma_\\nu} \\phi_i\\hat{U}_n^{n+1}d\\Gamma_\\nu \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq37} I_5 = \\int_\\Gamma \\phi_i U_n^n d\\Gamma \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq38} I_6 = \\int_{\\overline{\\Gamma}_\\nu} \\phi_i U_n^{n+1} d\\overline{\\Gamma}_\\nu \\end{equation}\\] Following standard finite-element procedures, and using appropriate essential and natural boundary conditions, SCHISM solves Eq. \\(\\ref{eq33}\\) to determine the elevations at all nodes. Note that the RHS terms \\(I_{3-6}\\) are known; in the case of \\(I_6\\) , the integrals on \\(\\overline{\\Gamma}_\\nu\\) need not be evaluated since the essential boundary conditions are imposed by eliminating corresponding rows and columns of the matrix. The matrix resulting from Eq. \\(\\ref{eq33}\\) is sparse and symmetric. It is also positive-definite as long as the depth \\(\\breve{H}\\) is non-negative ( ihhat=1 ); numerical experiments indicated that even this restriction can be relaxed for many practical applications that include shallow areas. We show that the addition of vegetation does not introduce additional stability constraint. The effects of the vegetation on \\(\\breve{H}\\) are generally similar to the bottom friction. For the 2D case, \\(\\breve{H}\\) is always positive. For the 3D emergent case, the vegetation term in the denominator is positive and so does not change the sign. For the 3D submerged case, as \\(\\alpha \\rightarrow 0\\) , previous results of Zhang and Baptista (2008) are recovered. As \\(\\alpha \\rightarrow \\infty\\) (i.e., very dense vegetation), the friction term (the second term in Eq. \\(\\ref{eq27}\\) ) dwarfs in comparison with the vegetation term (the third term in Eq. \\(\\ref{eq27}\\) ), and therefore the friction is negligible under dense vegetation. Since \\(c \\rightarrow 1\\) as \\(\\alpha \\rightarrow \\infty\\) , \\(\\breve{H}\\) approaches the submergence \\(H-H^\\alpha\\) , which is positive. When the submergence is very small (i.e. almost emergent vegetation), \\(\\breve{H} \\rightarrow 0\\) and the conditioning of the matrix would somewhat deteriorate but the model remains stable. Physically, this means that very strong shear will develop near the canopy. It\u2019s important to notice that the friction-modified depth is different between 2D and 3D cases, which has implications in shallow depths. We show more details of the evaluation of the integrals \\(I_i\\) below. The corresponding constant for 2D prisms is always positive (see below) and therefore the 2D mode is inherently more stable than 3D mode; consequently, judiciously leveraging SCHISM\u2019s polyphorphism enhances stability near the wetting and drying interface. The matrix can be efficiently solved using a pre-conditioned Conjugate Gradient method ( Casulli and Cattani 1994 ). This simple matrix solver is implemented in SCHISM; alternatively, the efficient parallel matrix solver PETSc can be used for large matrices. In the model, the decision on 2D/3D emergent/3D submerged scenarios is made at each side (where the velocity is defined) based on the total depths from the previous time step and the transition of regimes is handled in the model. Integral \\(I_3\\) \u00b6 This is a boundary integral that only need to be evaluated when the node \\(i\\) is located on an open boundary segment where Neuman-type B.C. is prescribed. Since the unknowns vary linearly along any side, we have (cf. Figure 1 ) - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq39} I_3 = \\sum_j \\frac{L_{ij}}{2} \\sum_{k=kbs}^{N_z-1} \\Delta z_{j,k+1} \\frac{\\hat{u}_{j,k+1}^{n+1} + \\hat{u}_{j,k}^{n+1}}{2} \\end{equation}\\] where the outer sum is carried out along the 2 adjacent open side \\(j\\) , \\(L_{ij}\\) is the side length, \\(\\Delta z_{j,k+1}\\) is the layer thickness along side \\(j\\) , and \\(kbs\\) is the local bottom index. Boundary node i with adjacent sides. If a Flather-type radiation condition ( Flather 1987 ) needs to be applied, it can be done in the following fashion - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq40} \\hat{U}_n^{n+1} - \\overline{U}_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{H}} (\\eta^{n+1} - \\overline{\\eta}) \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\overline{U}_n\\) and \\(\\overline{\\eta}\\) are specified mean incoming current and mean elevation. Then - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq41} I_3 = \\sum_j \\frac{L_{ij}(\\overline{U}_n)_{ij}}{2} + \\frac{L_{ij}\\sqrt{gH_{ij}}}{6} \\left[ 2(\\eta_i^{n+1} - \\overline{\\eta}_i) + (\\eta_j^{n+1} - \\overline{\\eta}_j) \\right] \\end{equation}\\] In this case, the unknown \\(\\eta^{n+1}\\) need to be moved to the LHS, and the diagonal (associated with \\(\\eta_i^{n+1}\\) ) is enhanced as a result and matrix symmetry is preserved. Integral \\(I_5\\) \u00b6 Similar to \\(I_3\\) , we have - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq42} I_5 = \\sum_j \\frac{L_{ij}}{2} \\sum_{k=kbs}^{N_z-1} \\Delta z_{j, k+1} \\frac{u_{j, k+1}^{n} + u_{j,k}^{n}}{2} \\end{equation}\\] Integral \\(I_1\\) \u00b6 This is the only implicit term. Referring to Figure 2 , we have - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq43} I_1 = \\sum_{j=1}^{Nb(i)} \\sum_{l=1}^{i34(j)} \\eta_{j,l}^{n+1} \\int_{A_j} \\hat{\\phi_{i'}} \\hat{\\phi_l} dA_j + g\\theta^2 \\Delta t^2 \\sum_{j=1}^{Nb(i)} \\overline{\\check{H}_j} \\sum_{l=1}^{i34(j)} \\eta_{j,l}^{n+1} \\int_{A_j} \\nabla\\hat{\\phi_{i'}}\\cdot\\nabla\\hat{\\phi_l} dA_j \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(j\\) is a neighbouring element of \\(i\\) , \\(i'\\) is the local index of node \\(i\\) inside element \\(j\\) , overbar in \\(\\overline{\\check{H}}\\) denotes element averating, and \\(\\hat{\\phi}\\) is the local linear shape function. We discuss the case of a triangle and quad element. Node ball used in calculating integral I 1. Case I: triangle \u00b6 The 2 integrals can be evaluated analytically as - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq44} \\int_{A_j} \\hat{\\phi_{i'}} \\hat{\\phi_l} dA_j = \\frac{1+\\delta_{i',l}}{12}A_j \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq45} \\int_{A_j} \\nabla\\hat{\\phi_{i'}} \\cdot \\nabla\\hat{\\phi_l} dA_j = \\frac{\\vec{i'}\\cdot\\vec{l}}{4A_j} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\vec{i'}\\) and \\(\\vec{l}\\) are two vectors along side \\(i'\\) and \\(l\\) respectively, and \\(\\delta_{i',l}\\) is the Kronecker delta - \\[\\begin{equation*} \\delta_{i',l} = \\begin{cases} 1, i' = l \\\\ 0, i' \\neq l \\end{cases} \\end{equation*}\\] Case II: Quad \u00b6 We can analytically evaluate integral Eq. \\(\\ref{eq44}\\) as - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq46} \\int_{A_j} \\hat{\\phi_{i'}}\\hat{\\phi_l}dA_j = \\frac{A_j}{16}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{3}\\xi_{i'}\\xi_l\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{1}{3}\\varsigma_{i'}\\varsigma_l\\right) + \\frac{B_1}{96}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{3}\\varsigma_{i'}\\varsigma_l\\right)\\left(\\xi_{i'}+\\xi_l\\right) + \\frac{B_2}{96}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{3}\\xi_{i'}\\xi_l\\right)\\left(\\varsigma_{i'}+\\varsigma_l\\right) \\end{equation}\\] Where \\((\\xi, \\varsigma)\\) are local coordinates, and \\(B_1\\) and \\(B_2\\) are 2 geometric constants (Figure 3 ) - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq47} \\begin{aligned} B_1 = \\left(\\vec{12}\\times\\vec{43}\\right)_k = \\left(x_2-x_1\\right)\\left(y_3-y_4\\right) - \\left(x_3-x_4\\right)\\left(y_2-y_1\\right)\\\\ B_2 = \\left(\\vec{23}\\times\\vec{14}\\right)_k \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] Quad element and local transformation. The other integral Eq. \\(\\ref{eq45}\\) cannot be evaluated analytically and so we use the 4-point Gauss quadrature. Integral \\(I_4\\) \u00b6 This integral contains most of the explicit terms. Most terms are straightforward to evaluate, e.g., using element averaging or analytical integration (in the case of volume sources/sinks); the integrals involving the shape function or its derivative can be calculated using the similar method as in \\(I_1\\) . Therefore we will only discuss the a few terms below given their importance in SCHISM. Baroclinicity \u00b6 Since a FVM is used to solve the tracers (including T,S) at the prism center, we evaluate the density gradient at prism center via a reconstruction method. Referring to Figure 4 , given a prism center '0', we first project the gradient onto vectors connecting adjacent prism centers - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq48} \\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial x}\\left(x_1-x_0\\right) + \\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial y}\\left(y_1-y_0\\right) = \\rho_1-\\rho_0 \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq49} \\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial x}\\left(x_2-x_0\\right) + \\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial y}\\left(y_2-y_0\\right) = \\rho_2-\\rho_0 \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq50} \\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial x}\\left(x_3-x_0\\right) + \\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial y}\\left(y_3-y_0\\right) = \\rho_3-\\rho_0 \\end{equation}\\] after a cubic spline interpolation has been performed to calculate the density at prism '1' at the same vertical location as \u20180\u2019 (i.e. ( \\(i\\) , \\(k\\) )). Note that if the element \\(i\\) is a quad, we will have 4 equations. We then solve pairs of equations to find for \\(\\nabla\\rho\\) , i.e., Eq. \\(\\ref{eq48}\\) with Eq. \\(\\ref{eq49}\\) , Eq. \\(\\ref{eq49}\\) with Eq. \\(\\ref{eq50}\\) , and Eq. \\(\\ref{eq50}\\) with Eq. \\(\\ref{eq48}\\) . If the 3 centers happen to be co-linear, the equations have no solution and are discarded; however, at least 1 pair has a valid solution. Reconstruction method. i is the element index and k is the vertical index. If a neighbor does not exist (boundary) or is dry, we replace the corresponding equation with the no-flux B.C.; e.g., if AB is such a side, then - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq51} \\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial y}\\left(x_A-x_B\\right) + \\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial x}\\left(y_B-y_A\\right) = 0 \\end{equation}\\] After the density gradients are found at prism centers, a simple linear interpolation in the vertical is used to calculate the gradients at side centers (and half levels).

Horizontal viscosity \u00b6 Momentum stabilization is an important consideration in designing advection and viscosity schemes. Zhang et al. (2016) demonstrated that the standard Laplacian viscosity is equivalent to the 5-point Shapiro filter (see below) on uniform grids; however, on non-uniform grids, it may behave like an \u2018amplifier\u2019 and therefore the filter form should be used instead (Figure 5a,b ) - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq52} \\nabla\\cdot\\left(\\mu\\nabla u\\right)\\Biggr|_0 = \\frac{\\mu_0}{\\sqrt{3}A_I}\\left(u_1+u_2+u_3+u_4-4u_0\\right) \\end{equation}\\] where all velocities have been interpolated onto a horizontal plane using linear interpolation in the vertical. Shapiro filters and viscosity stencil for (a) triangular and (b) quadrangular elements. 'I' and 'II' are 2 adjacent elements of side of interest ('0'). The extended stencil used in constructing bi-harmonic viscosity is shown in (c). The special case of a boundary side is shown in (d). The bi-harmonic viscosity is often superior to the Laplacian viscosity as it is more discriminating in removing sub-grid instabilities without adversely affecting the resolved scales of flow (Griffies and Hallberg 2000). The bi-harmonic viscosity can be implemented by applying the Laplacian operator twice. Referring to Figure 5c , we have - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq53} \\begin{aligned} -\\lambda\\nabla^4u\\Biggr|_0 &= -\\lambda\\gamma_3\\left( \\nabla^2 u_1 + \\nabla^2 u_2 + \\nabla^2 u_3 + \\nabla^2 u_4 - 4\\nabla^2 u_0 \\right)\\\\ &= \\frac{\\gamma_2}{\\Delta t}\\left[ 7\\left( u_1 + u_2 + u_3 + u_4\\right) - u_{1a} - u_{1b} - u_{2a} - u_{2b} - u_{3a} - u_{3b} - u_{4a} - u_{4b} - 20u_0 \\right] \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\lambda\\) is a hyper viscosity in \\(m^4/s\\) , \\(\\gamma_3 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}A_I}\\) and \\(\\gamma_2 = \\lambda\\gamma_3^2\\Delta t\\) is a diffusion-number-like dimensionless constant.

Nepf and Vivoni (2000) demonstrated that there are two zones for submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). In the upper canopy (called the \u2018vertical exchange zone\u2019), mean shear at the top of the canopy produces vertical turbulent exchange with the overlying water, which plays a significant role in the momentum balance. The lower canopy (\u2018longitudinal change zone\u2019 as in Nepf and Vivoni, 2000 ) communicates with surrounding water predominantly through longitudinal advection. The extent of the vertical exchange of momentum between the vegetation zone and overlying water is dependent on the submergence.

Note that the RHS terms \\(I_{3-6}\\) are known; in the case of \\(I_6\\) , the integrals on \\(\\overline{\\Gamma}_\\nu\\) need not be evaluated since the essential boundary conditions are imposed by eliminating corresponding rows and columns of the matrix. The matrix resulting from Eq. \\(\\ref{eq33}\\) is sparse and symmetric. It is also positive-definite as long as the depth \\(\\breve{H}\\) is non-negative ( ihhat=1 ); numerical experiments indicated that even this restriction can be relaxed for many practical applications that include shallow areas. We show that the addition of vegetation does not introduce additional stability constraint. The effects of the vegetation on \\(\\breve{H}\\) are generally similar to the bottom friction. For the 2D case, \\(\\breve{H}\\) is always positive. For the 3D emergent case, the vegetation term in the denominator is positive and so does not change the sign. For the 3D submerged case, as \\(\\alpha \\rightarrow 0\\) , previous results of Zhang and Baptista (2008) are recovered. As \\(\\alpha \\rightarrow \\infty\\) (i.e., very dense vegetation), the friction term (the second term in Eq. \\(\\ref{eq27}\\) ) dwarfs in comparison with the vegetation term (the third term in Eq. \\(\\ref{eq27}\\) ), and therefore the friction is negligible under dense vegetation. Since \\(c \\rightarrow 1\\) as \\(\\alpha \\rightarrow \\infty\\) , \\(\\breve{H}\\) approaches the submergence \\(H-H^\\alpha\\) , which is positive. When the submergence is very small (i.e. almost emergent vegetation), \\(\\breve{H} \\rightarrow 0\\) and the conditioning of the matrix would somewhat deteriorate but the model remains stable. Physically, this means that very strong shear will develop near the canopy. It\u2019s important to notice that the friction-modified depth is different between 2D and 3D cases, which has implications in shallow depths. We show more details of the evaluation of the integrals \\(I_i\\) below. The corresponding constant for 2D prisms is always positive (see below) and therefore the 2D mode is inherently more stable than 3D mode; consequently, judiciously leveraging SCHISM\u2019s polyphorphism enhances stability near the wetting and drying interface. The matrix can be efficiently solved using a pre-conditioned Conjugate Gradient method ( Casulli and Cattani 1994 ). This simple matrix solver is implemented in SCHISM; alternatively, the efficient parallel matrix solver PETSc can be used for large matrices. In the model, the decision on 2D/3D emergent/3D submerged scenarios is made at each side (where the velocity is defined) based on the total depths from the previous time step and the transition of regimes is handled in the model.","title":"General case"},{"location":"schism/barotropic-solver.html#integral-i_3","text":"This is a boundary integral that only need to be evaluated when the node \\(i\\) is located on an open boundary segment where Neuman-type B.C. is prescribed.

Under this method, the momentum advection is approximated as - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq01} \\frac{D\\pmb{u}}{Dt}\\cong\\frac{\\pmb{u}(\\pmb{x}, t^{n+1}) - \\pmb{u}(\\pmb{x}^*, t^n)}{\\Delta t} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\pmb{x}\\) is a shorthand for \\((x, y, z)\\) , and \\(\\pmb{x}^*\\) is the location of the foot of characteristic line (FOCL), calculated from the characteristic equation - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq02} \\frac{D\\pmb{x}}{Dt} = \\pmb{u} \\end{equation}\\] The location \\(\\pmb{x}^*\\) is found via a backtracking step, standard in an ELM, via backward integration of Eq. \\(\\ref{eq02}\\) starting from a given location ( \\(\\pmb{x}\\) ), which is in our case a side center at whole level where the horizontal velocity \\(\\pmb{u}\\) is defined. The fixed starting location (Eulerian framework) followed by a Lagrangian tracking step gives the name Eulerian-Lagrangian method. Therefore the ELM consists of two major steps: a backtracking step (Figure 1 a) and an interpolation step at FOCL (Figure 1 b). We further sub-divide the tracking step into smaller intervals (based on local flow gradients), and use a 2nd-order Runge-Kutta method (mid-point method) within each interval, in order to accurately track the trajectory. Although exact integration methods have been proposed ( Ham et al. 2006 ), their implementation is complicated for a 3D (triangular and quadrangular) prism and in the exceptional cases of wetting and drying interfaces. The interpolation step serves as an important control for numerical diffusion/dispersion in the ELM, and we therefore experimented with several options as shown below. However, before we get to this, we first explain how SCHISM converts the velocities at sides to the velocities at nodes, as the latter are required in the interpolation of the velocities along the characteristic line and at the FOCL (Figure 1 ). Two steps in Eulerian\u2013Lagrangian method. (a) The characteristic equation is integrated backward in space and time, starting from a side center (the green dot). The characteristic line is further subdivided into smaller intervals (bounded by the red dots), based on local flow gradients, and a 2nd-order Runge\u2013Kutta method is used within each interval. The foot of characteristic line is marked as a yellow dot. Note that the vertical position of the trajectory is also changing and so the tracking is in 3D space. (b) Interpolation is carried out at FOCL (yellow dot), based on either the nodes of the containing elements (blue dots), or the 2-tier neighborhood (blue plus red dots; the latter are the neighbors of the blue dots) using a dual kriging method. Proper linear vertical interpolation has been carried out first to bring the values at each node onto a horizontal plane before the horizontal interpolation is done. As explained by Danilov (2013) , the conversion method used bears important ramifications: judicious averaging (e.g., from side to elements or to node etc.) may greatly reduce the need later on for filters to remove the inertial spurious modes while still keeping the inherent numerical dissipation low. In fact, one could have used the discontinuous velocity calculated within each element to carry out the backtracking, but this would introduce insufficient amount of dissipation to suppress the inertial modes. In the first approach (\u2018MA\u2019 hereafter; indvel=1 ), we use inverse distance weights to interpolate from velocities at surrounding sides onto a node (Figure 2a ). This introduces diffusion which may be excessive in our experience, and therefore no further stabilization (via filters or viscosity) is required for this approach (see the discussion of stabilization in Danilov 2013 ). This approach works well in shallow waters especially for the inundation process, as numerical stability often trumps the order of accuracy there. Two methods of converting side velocities to a node velocity. (a) Inverse distance interpolation from sides (blue dots) to node (yellow dot); (b) use of FEM shape function to find the node velocity within each element first (the red arrow), i.e. u1 = uII + uIII \u2013uI , followed by a simple averaging method to calculate the final value from all of its surrounding elements (dashed arrows) The 2nd approach (\u2018MB\u2019 hereafter; indvel=0 ) is more elegant and utilizes the (linear) shape function in FEM within each element to calculate the node velocities. This is equivalent to using the \\(P^{NC}\\) non-conformal shape function ( Le Roux et al. 2005 ) as one essentially interpolates based on information at sides (Figure 2b ). Because each element produces a velocity vector at each of its nodes, the final node velocity is the simple average of the values calculated from all of the surrounding elements (Figure 2a ). This approach introduces much less dissipation, but does exhibit inertial spurious modes. As a result, further stabilization is required. To this end, SCHISM uses a 5-point Shapiro filter ( Shapiro 1970 ) as illustrated in Figure 5ab ; the velocity at a side \u20180\u2019 is filtered as - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq03} \\tilde{\\pmb{u}_0} = \\pmb{u}_0 + \\frac{\\gamma}{4}\\left( \\pmb{u}_1 + \\pmb{u}_2 + \\pmb{u}_3 + \\pmb{u}_4 -4\\pmb{u}_0 \\right) \\end{equation}\\] with the strength usually set as \\(\\gamma = 0.5\\) . It\u2019s obvious that the filter is analogous to the Laplacian viscosity implementation in the previous section. It proves to be very effective in removing the sub-grid scale inertial spurious modes; however, it tends introduces too much dissipation in the eddying regime, and therefore should be used only in the non-eddying regime, i.e. shallow waters. Since it\u2019s equivalent to the Laplacian viscosity, we may remove this filter in the future options and ask users to use ihorcon=1 instead. Once the node velocities are found via MA or MB, the interpolation at the FOCL is carried out in 3D space. A simple linear interpolation is used in the vertical dimension as the results from the cubic-spline interpolation turned out to be similar, due to more confined spatial scales and smaller grid sizes in the vertical. The horizontal interpolation can be done using either a simple linear shape function based on all of the nodes of the containing element (\u2018LI\u2019 hereafter), or a higher-order dual kriging method (\u2018KR\u2019 hereafter) suggested by Le Roux et al. (1997) Figure 5b The latter requires larger stencil around the FOCL, and for best parallel efficiency we use a 2-tier neighborhood as shown in Figure 5b . Given a total of N nodes available in the 2-tier neighborhood, the interpolation function is constructed as ( Le Roux 1997 ) - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq04} f^h(x,y) = (\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 x + \\alpha_3 y) + \\sum_{i=1}^N \\beta_i K(r_i) \\end{equation}\\] where the first 3 RHS terms inside the parentheses represent a mean drift (modeled as a linear function), and the 2nd term is the fluctuation part, \\(\\alpha_j\\) , \\(\\beta_i\\) are unknown coefficients, and \\(r_i\\) is the distance between ( \\(x\\) , \\(y\\) ) and ( \\(x_i\\) , \\(y_i\\) ), with \\(i\\) being a node. The following forms of the generalized covariance function are commonly used ( Le Roux et al. 1997 ) - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq05} K(r) = -r, r^2\\log(r), r^3, -r^5, r^7 \\end{equation}\\] with increasing dispersion for the higher-degree functions; therefore in practice, the last two functions are seldom used. In the following we will refer to the first 3 functions as \u2018KR1\u2019, \u2018KR2\u2019 and \u2018KR3\u2019 respectively. The equations to solve for the unknown coefficients are - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq06} \\begin{aligned} f^h(x_i, y_i) = d_i, 1 \\leq i \\leq N\\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\beta_i = 0\\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i\\beta_i = 0\\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i\\beta_i = 0 \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(d_i\\) are given data at each node. The 1st equation in Eqs. \\(\\ref{eq06}\\) indicates that the dual kriging is an exact interpolator, and the other 3 equations are derived from minimization of the variance of estimation error ( Le Roux et al. 1997 ). Note that the matrix of Eqs. \\(\\ref{eq06}\\) is dependent only on geometry and therefore can be inverted and stored before the time stepping loop to achieve greater efficiency. After the coefficients are found, the interpolation at FOCL is done via Eqs. \\(\\ref{eq04}\\) . The smaller stencil used here compared to that used by Le Roux et al. (1997) leads to larger numerical dispersion. Therefore an effective method must be found to control the dispersion, and we use the ELAD scheme of Shchepetkin and McWilliams (1998) for this purpose. The essence of ELAD is to iteratively diffuse the excess field, instead of the original signal, using a diffusion operator/smoother. The viscosity scheme presented in the previous sub-section is used as the diffusion operator. The procedure is summarized as follows - Find the local max/min at FOCL. Assuming that the prism at FOCL starting from a side \\(j\\) and level \\(k\\) is ( \\(kf\\) , \\(nf\\) ), where \\(nf\\) is the element index and \\(kf\\) is the vertical index, the max/min are found in the prism ( \\(kf\\) , \\(nf\\) ) as - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq07} \\begin{aligned} u_{k, j}^{max} = \\max_{l=1:i34, k=-1,0} u_{kf+k, im(l, nf)}\\\\ u_{k, j}^{min} = \\min_{l=1:i34, k=-1,0} u_{kf+k, im(l, nf)} \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(im()\\) enumerates all nodes of an element. The excess field associated with (k,j) is - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq08} \\varepsilon_{k, j}^{(1)} = \\max\\left[ 0, u_{k,j}^{n+1, 1} - u_{k,j}^{\\max} \\right] + \\min\\left[ 0, u_{k,j}^{n+1, 1} - u_{k,j}^{\\min} \\right] \\end{equation}\\] where \\(u_{k,j}^{n+1, 1}\\) is the interpolated value at FOCL. Apply a global diffusion operator to \\(\\varepsilon\\) to obtain estimated velocity at the next iteration - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq09} u_{k,j}^{n+1, 2} = u_{k, j}^{n+1, 1} + \\mu'\\Delta t \\nabla^2 \\varepsilon_{k, j}^{(1)}, \\forall j, k \\end{equation}\\] and we use 5-point filter with maximum strength - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq10} u_{k,j}^{n+1, 2} = u_{k, j}^{n+1, 1} + \\frac{1}{8} \\left[ \\varepsilon_{k, 1}^{(1)} + \\varepsilon_{k, 2}^{(1)} + \\varepsilon_{k, 3}^{(1)} + \\varepsilon_{k, 4}^{(1)} - 4 \\varepsilon_{k, j}^{(1)} \\right] \\end{equation}\\] where subscripts 1-4 are the 4 adjacent sides of \\(j\\) (Figure 5ab ); Calculate the new excess field using \\(u_{k, j}^{n+1, 2}\\) in (2) and apply the filter (3) again to find the velocity at the next iteration \\(u_{k,j}^{n+1, 3}\\) . Iterate until the excess field falls below a prescribed threshold. In practice, 10 iterations are usually sufficient to bring the excess field below an acceptable level ( \\(10^{-4} m/s\\) ); the remaining excess field is then further smoothed with the viscosity. The filter in Eqs. \\(\\ref{eq10}\\) is conservative in the sense that it only redistributes excess mass and does not introduce any additional mass. This is similar in spirit to the conservative scheme of Gravel and Staniforth (1994) but appears simpler in implementation. At a boundary side \\(j\\) , Eqs. \\(\\ref{eq10}\\) is modified in order to maintain the conservation - \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq11} u_{k,j}^{n+1, 2} = u_{k, j}^{n+1, 1} + \\frac{1}{8} \\left[ \\varepsilon_{k, 1}^{(1)} + \\varepsilon_{k, 2}^{(1)} - 2 \\varepsilon_{k, j}^{(1)} \\right] \\end{equation}\\] where subscripts '1' and '2' are the 2 adjacent sides of \\(j\\) (Figure 5d ). Note that since the linear interpolation scheme (LI) does not introduce local extrema, ELAD is not applied there. The various schemes presented above can be freely combined, resulting in schemes like \u2018MA-LI\u2019, \u2018MB-KR2\u2019 etc. Experiments indicate that overall the best scheme is MB-LI for both eddying and non-eddying regimes ( Zhang et al. 2016 ).

Although there are many ways of generating a \\(LSC^2\\) grid, a convenient start is the Vanishing Quasi Sigma (VQS) suggested by Dukhovskoy et al. (2009). The essence of VQS is to first design a master (vertical) grid at selected reference depths, and then use this master grid to interpolate the local z coordinates at a grid node based on the local depth and 2 references depths that contains the depth (Figure 5 ). The original VQS also requires masking of thin layers near the bottom, and is not free of Z-like staircases near the bottom (Figure 5d ). Since SCHISM is an implicit model, we do not need such special treatment, and furthermore, \u2018fill in\u2019 unmatched levels with shaved cells to get \\(LSC^2\\) . As can be seen from Figure 5 , a major advantage of \\(LSC^2\\) , besides being very economical (as fewer/more # of levels are used in shallow/deep), is that it resembles a Z grid near the surface and interior of the water column while behaving like terrain-following grid near the bottom. As demonstrated in Zhang et al. (2015, 2016ab), \\(LSC^2\\) is instrumental in reducing unphysical diapycnal mixing and pressure-gradient errors (PGE). A well-designed \\(LSC^2\\) grid completely removes the need for bathymetry manipulation (e.g. smoothing/clipping), thus enabling a faithful representation of the bathymetry/topography, as demonstrated in those papers. However, some experience is required in designing a good \\(LSC^2\\) grid, and so beginners may want to start with the \\(SZ\\) grid. $LSC^2$ grid. (a) Horizontal grid showing the location of the transect (yellow line); (b) master grid at 19 reference depths; (c) corresponding vertical grid of the transect in (a), with degenerate prisms/shaved cells located near the bottom. (d) shows a typical VQS grid that contains staircases near the bottom. Prisms \u00b6 Regardless which type of vgrid is chosen, the basic 3D computational unit in SCHISM is a triangular or quad prism, with 3 or 4 vertical faces and uneven top and bottom faces (Figure 6 ). SCHISM solves all equations in the original Z space for consistency; even with spherical coordinates (lon/lat), the equations are not transformed but instead multiple coordinate frames are used (see below). A staggering scheme a la Arakawa-CD grid is used to define variables. The surface elevations are defined at the nodes. The horizontal velocities are defined at the side centers and whole levels. The vertical velocities are defined at the element centers and whole levels, and the tracer concentration is defined at prism center, as they are solved with a finite-volume method. The linear shape functions are used for elevations and velocities (the latter has a vertical linear shape function as well). For quad elements, the bi-linear shape function is used. Basic 3D computational unit in SCHISM where variables are staggered. At the end of each time step, the vertical levels are updated to account for free-surface movement. Although method like Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) can be used to march the vertical levels in time, this is not done at the moment. Therefore, the state variables are simply moved to the new vertical location without re-interpolation. In the model sometimes vertical interpolation is required (e.g., calculation of baroclinc force). We use cubic spline interpolation in the vertical to minimize diffusion. Polymorphism \u00b6 The combination of \\(LSC^2\\) vertical grid ( Zhang et al. 2015 ) and horizontal mixed-element grids results in an extremely flexible grid system that has great practical applications. We demonstrate this with a toy problem for coastal ocean-estuary-river system depicted in Figure 7 . Since the tracer concentrations are defined at the prism centers, a row of quads and 1 vertical layer resembles a 1D model (Figure 7c ). Similarly, a row of quads with multiple vertical layers leads to 2DV configuration (Figure 7c ). Some parts of the shoals that are sufficiently shallow are discretized using 1 vertical layer (Figure 7b ), which is a 2DH configuration. The deeper part of the domain is discretized using full 3D prisms, but with a larger number of layers in the deeper depths than in the shallow depths, in a typical \\(LSC^2\\) fashion (Figure 7a ; Zhang et al. 2015 ). Different types of grids are seamlessly welded into a single SCHISM grid, resulting in greatest efficiency. With some care taken of the consistent bottom friction formulations across 1D, 2D and 3D, the model results show no discontinuity across different types of grids. The use of 1D or 2D cells in shallow areas also enhances numerical stability, as they are well suited and more stable for inundation process than 3D cells; e.g., the crowding of multiple 3D layers in the shallow depths is not conducive to stability. Model polymorphism illustrated with a toy problem. The mixed triangular-quadrangular grid and the bathymetry are shown in the foreground. The vertical transect grid along the redline going from deep ocean into estuary (\u2018shipping channel\u2019) is shown in insert (a). The 3D view of the grid near the head of estuary is shown in insert (b), with few layers on the shallow shoals. The grid near the upstream river is shown in insert (c), where transition from 2DV to 1D grid can be seen. In the test, a M2 tide is applied at the ocean boundary, and fresh water discharges are imposed at the heads of the river and estuary.

In general, all state variables ( \\(\\eta\\) , \\(\\pmb{u}\\) , \\(C\\) ) are specified at \\(t=0\\) as I.C. and these are also specified at all open lateral boundary segments (open ocean, rivers etc). However, not all variables need to be specified at all boundary segments and we\u2019ll revisit this in the input-output section, i.e., bctides . The vertical B.C. for (Eq 1-4) are described in detail below as these impact the numerical scheme. Note that these only apply to 3D cells; for 2D cells, Eq. 1a has taken into account the B.C. At the sea surface, SCHISM enforces the balance between the internal Reynolds stress and the applied shear stress. \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu \\frac{\\partial \\pmb{u}}{\\partial z} = \\pmb{\\tau}_w, \\text{ at } z = \\eta \\end{equation}\\] where the stress \\(\\pmb{\\tau}_z\\) can be parameterized using the approach of Zeng et al. (1998) or the simpler approach of Pond and Pickard (1998) . If the Wind Wave Model is invoked, it can also be calculated from the wave model. Because the bottom boundary layer is usually not well resolved in ocean models, the no-slip condition at the sea or river bottom ( \\(\\pmb{u} = w = 0\\) ) is replaced by a balance between the internal Reynolds stress and the bottom frictional stress. \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu \\frac{\\partial \\pmb{u}}{\\partial z} = \\pmb{\\tau}_b, \\text{ at } z=-h \\end{equation}\\] The specific form of the bottom stress \\(\\pmb{\\tau}_b\\) depends on the type of boundary layer used and here we will only discuss the turbulent boundary layer below (Blumberg and Mellor 1987), given its prevalent usage in ocean modeling. The bottom stress is then - \\[\\begin{equation} \\pmb{\\tau}_b = C_D \\left| \\pmb{u}_b \\right| \\pmb{u}_b \\equiv \\chi \\pmb{u}_b \\end{equation}\\] The velocity profile in the interior of the bottom boundary layer obeys the logarithmic law, which is smoothly matched to the exterior flow at the top of the boundary layer. \\[\\begin{equation} \\pmb{u} = \\frac{ln[(z+h)/z_0]}{ln(\\delta_b/z_0)}\\pmb{u}_b, z_0-h \\leq z \\leq \\delta_b -h \\end{equation}\\] Here, \\(\\delta_b\\) is the thickness of the bottom computational cell (assuming that the bottom is sufficiently resolved in SCHISM that the bottom cell is inside the boundary layer), \\(z_0\\) is the bottom roughness, and \\(\\pmb{u}_b\\) is the velocity measured at the top of the bottom computational cell. Therefore the Reynolds stress inside the boundary layer is derived as - \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu \\frac{\\partial \\pmb{u}}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\nu}{(z+h)ln(\\delta_b/z_0)} \\pmb{u}_b \\end{equation}\\] Utilizing the turbulence closure theory discussed below, we can show that the Reynolds stress is constant inside the boundary layer - \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu \\frac{\\partial \\pmb{u}}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\kappa_0}{ln(\\delta_b/z_0)} C_D^{1/2} \\left| \\pmb{u}_b \\right| \\pmb{u}_b, z_0-h \\leq z \\leq \\delta_b -h \\end{equation}\\] and the drag coefficient is calculated from Eq. 7, 8, and 11 as - \\[\\begin{equation} C_D = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\kappa_0} ln(\\delta_b/z_0) \\right) ^{-2} \\end{equation}\\] which is the drag formula as discussed in Blumberg and Mellor (1987) . Eq. 11 also shows that the vertical viscosity term in the momentum equation vanishes inside the boundary layer. This fact will be utilized in the numerical formulation. Turbulence closure \u00b6 Eq 1-4 are not closed and must be supplemented by turbulence closure equations for the viscosity/diffusivity. We use the Generic Length-scale (GLS) model of Umlauf and Burchard (2003) , which has the advantage of encompassing most of the Eq 6 closure models \\(k-\\varepsilon\\) ( Rodi 1984 ); \\(k-\\omega\\) ( Wilcox 1998 ; Mellor and Yamada, 1982 ). In this framework, the transport, production, and dissipation of the turbulent kinetic energy ( \\(K\\) ) and of a generic length-scale variable ( \\(\\psi\\) ) are governed by - \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{Dk}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left( \\nu_k^{\\psi} \\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial z} \\right) + \\nu M^2 + \\kappa N^2 - \\varepsilon + c_{fk} \\alpha \\left| \\pmb{u} \\right|^3 \\mathcal{H} (z_v - z) \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{D \\psi}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left( \\nu_{\\psi} \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial z} \\right) + \\frac{\\psi}{k}\\left[ c_{\\psi 1} \\nu M^2 + c_{\\psi 3} \\kappa N^2 - c_{\\psi 2}\\varepsilon F_{wall} + c_{f\\psi} \\alpha \\left| \\pmb{u} \\right|^3 \\mathcal{H}(z_v-z) \\right] \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\nu_k^{\\psi}\\) and \\(\\nu_{\\psi}\\) are vertical turbulent diffusivities, \\(c_{\\psi 1}\\) , \\(c_{\\psi 2}\\) , and \\(c_{\\psi 3}\\) are model-specific constants ( Umlauf and Burchard 2003 ), \\(F_{wall}\\) is a wall proximity function, \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) are shear and buoyancy frequencies, and \\(\\varepsilon\\) is a dissipation rate. The generic length-scale is defined as - \\[\\begin{equation} \\psi = (c_{\\mu}^0)^p K^m \\ell^n \\end{equation}\\] where \\(c_{\\mu}^0 = 0.3^{1/2}\\) and \\(\\ell\\) is the turbulence mixing length. The specific choices of the constants \\(p\\) , \\(m\\) , and \\(n\\) lead to the different closure models mentioned above. Finally, vertical viscosities and diffusivities as appeared in Eq 1-4 are related to \\(K\\) , \\(ell\\) , and stability functions - \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} \\nu = \\sqrt{2} s_m K^{1/2} \\ell \\\\ \\kappa = \\sqrt{2} s_h K^{1/2} \\ell \\\\ \\nu_k^{\\psi} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\sigma_k^{\\psi}} \\\\ \\nu_{\\psi} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\sigma_{\\psi}} \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] where the Schmidt numbers \\(\\sigma_k^{\\psi}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{\\psi}\\) are model-specific constants. The stability functions ( \\(s_m\\) and \\(s_h\\) ) are given by an Algebraic Stress Model (e.g.: Kantha and Clayson 1994 , Canuto et al. 2001 , or Galperin et al. 1988 ). Following Shimizu and Tsujimoto (1994; ST94 hereafter) , we set \\(c_{fk} = 0.07\\) and \\(c_{f\\psi} = 0.16\\) . At the free surface and at the bottom of rivers and oceans, the turbulent kinetic energy and the mixing length are specified as Direchlet boundary conditions - \\[\\begin{equation} K = \\frac{1}{2} B_1^{2/3} \\left| \\pmb{\\tau_b} \\right|, \\text{ or } \\frac{1}{2} B_1^{2/3} \\left| \\pmb{\\tau_w} \\right| \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\ell = \\kappa_o d_b \\text{ or } \\kappa_0 d_s \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\pmb{\\tau_b}\\) is a bottom frictional stress, \\(\\kappa_0 = 0.4\\) is the von Karman\u2019s constant, \\(B_1\\) is a constant, and \\(d_b\\) and \\(d_s\\) are the distances to the bottom and the free surface, respectively.

The underlying assumption used here is to treat the vegetation as arrays of solid cylinders, which is only a first-order approximation of the problem. Flexibility of the vegetation, sheltering effects within a cluster of vegetation can lead to one to two orders of reduction in the drag forces, and Gaylord et al. (2008) showed that the drag formulation is also species dependent. These additional complexities are outside the scope of the current study. In this paper, we assume \\(C_{Dv}\\) is a constant, but a vertically varying \\(C_{Dv}\\) (as suggested by Nepf and Vivoni 2000 and others) can be easily added as well; the latter can be used to approximate flexible stems ( Nepf and Vivoni 2000 ; Luhar and Nepf 2011).

The coordinates are related to the longitude and latitude of a point on the spherical surface as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq01} \\begin{cases} x_g = R_0 \\cos\\phi\\cos\\lambda\\\\ y_g = R_o \\cos\\phi\\sin\\lambda\\\\ z_g = R_0 \\sin\\phi \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] Local frame , located at a point on sphere (e.g., node/side center/element centroid): The 3 axes of this frame are: \\(\\pmb\\lambda^0\\) (zonal), \\(\\pmb\\phi^0\\) (meridional North), and \\(\\pmb r^0 = \\pmb\\lambda^0 \\times \\pmb\\phi^0\\) (radial). The relationship between this frame and global frame is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq02} \\begin{aligned} \\pmb\\lambda^0 = -\\sin\\lambda\\pmb i + \\cos\\lambda\\pmb j\\\\ \\pmb\\phi^0 = -\\cos\\lambda\\sin\\phi\\pmb i - \\sin\\lambda\\sin\\phi j + \\cos \\phi \\pmb k \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] The frame \\((\\pmb\\lambda^0, \\pmb\\phi^0, \\pmb r^0)\\) is then the local \\((x, y, z)\\) frame. Here, \\(\\pmb i, \\pmb j, \\pmb k\\) are unit vectors of the global frame. Strictly speaking this frame is undefined at the 2 poles, but we can still use it there as long as the axes are unique. Further assumption is made that when the origins are close to each other, the z-axes also coincide with each other, e.g. in the back-tracking part etc. This is reasonable as the relevant distances are much smaller than \\(R_0\\) . With the aid from all these frames, the equations can be solved in a very similar way as in Cartesian frame. The main difference is in the evaluation of the vectors in the local frame. The changes to the code are therefore minimal. Below are some important info about arrays used in the code that are affected by lon/lat frames: (xnd,ynd,znd) , (xcj,ycj,zcj) , (xctr,yctr,zctr) are global coordinates of node, side center and element centroid for ics=1 or 2 . If ics=1 (Cartesian), znd=zcj=zctr= 0 ; (znl, zs, ze) are local z-coordinates measured vertically upward from the undisturbed surface (i.e. local frame when ics=2 ), at node, side, and element; eframe(1:3,1:3,1:nea) is the tensor for the element frame (w.r.t. global frame). The 2nd index indicates axid id (1=x; 2=y; 3=z) and the 1st index indicates tensor components. sframe and pframe are similar. References Comblen, R., Legrand, S., Deleersnijder, E., and Legat, V.

All of the tracers, including T,S, sediment (if invoked) etc are solved simultaneously for efficiency. The transport equation for a generic tracer C is given by: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq01} \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\pmb{u}C) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left( \\kappa \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial z} \\right) + F_h \\end{equation}\\] where \\(F_h\\) includes vertical settling term (see Vertical movement ), source/sink and also horizontal viscosity terms.

In the following, we describe the numerical algorithm starting from the simplest 1st-order upwind scheme to the more complex 3rd-order WENO. In the newer versions, the pure upwind and explicit TVD schemes have been deprecated. Upwind \u00b6 Since most of the variables below are defined at prism center, we will use shorthand like \\(i\\) etc to denote a prism at level \\(k + 1/2\\) when there is no confusion. Also we often omit the superscript \\(n\\) in the explicit terms for brevity. A FV discretization of Eq. \\(\\ref{eq01}\\) for prism \\(i\\) is : \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq03} C_i^{m+1} = C_i^m - \\frac{\\Delta t'}{V_i}\\sum_{j\\in S} Q_j C_{j*} + (F_h)_i^n \\Delta t' + \\frac{A_i \\Delta t'}{V_i} \\left[ \\kappa_{i, k} \\frac{C_{i, k+1}^{m+1} - C_{i,k}^{m+1}}{\\Delta z_{i, k+\\frac{1}{2}}} - \\kappa_{i, k-1} \\frac{C_{i,k}^{m+1} - C_{i,k-1}^{m+1}}{\\Delta z_{i, k-\\frac{1}{2}}} \\right], (k = kbe + 1, \\cdots, N_z) \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\Delta t' \\neq \\Delta t\\) is the transport time step (subject to Courant condition below), \\(V_i\\) is the volume of the prism, \\(C_i\\) s a shorthand for \\(C_{i, k}\\) (i.e., concentration at prism \\((i,k)\\) ), and \\(Q_j\\) is the flux at face \\(j\\) outward of the prism. Note that we have treated the diffusion term implicitly. For the sake of brevity we\u2019ll drop the source and diffusion terms from now on and focus on the advection term. With the upwind scheme, the face concentration is defined as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq04} C_{j*} = \\begin{cases} C_i, j \\in S^+\\\\ C_j, j \\in S^- \\end{cases} \\equiv C_{up} \\end{equation}\\] where we have used shorthand for concentration at prism \\(j\\) (i.e. the prism adjacent to \\((i,k)\\) from face j), and \\(S^+\\) and \\(S^-\\) are outflow and inflow faces respectively. The face concentration take different forms with higher-order schemes. Mass conservation Eq. \\(\\ref{eq03}\\) is the starting point of all FV solvers in SCHISM, from which a conservation statement can be derived. Assuming no zero fluxes at surface, bottom and lateral boundary, summing up over all prisms leads to: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\sum_i V_i C_i^{m+1} = \\sum_i V_i C_i^m - \\Delta t' \\sum_{j\\in FS} Q_j C_j \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(FS\\) stands for free surface. Note that the volume \\(V_i\\) is evaluated at previous step \\(m\\) . The 2nd term in Eq. \\(\\ref{eq03}\\) cancels out at all faces (or vanish at lateral boundary) except at the free surface. The 2nd term in above equation represents the contribution from the surface movement and is supposed to account for the movement from \\(m\\) to \\(m+1\\) . However, this balance is not precise (time truncation error). In the case of \\(TVD^2\\) or \\(WENO\\) ( itr_met>2 ), there is also additional splitting error. Therefore mass conservation is only good up to time truncation error. Retaining only the advection term, Eq. \\(\\ref{eq03}\\) then becomes: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq05} C_i^{m+1} = C_i \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\Delta t'}{V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S^+} \\left| Q_j \\right| \\right) + \\frac{\\Delta t'}{V_i}\\sum_{j\\in S^+} \\left| Q_j \\right| C_j \\end{equation}\\] We have utilized the volume conservation: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq06} \\sum_{j\\in S^+} \\left| Q_j \\right| = \\sum_{j\\in S^-} \\left| Q_j \\right| \\end{equation}\\] Therefore the Courant condition is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq07} 1 - \\frac{\\Delta t'}{V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S^+} \\left| Q_j \\right| \\geq 0 \\end{equation}\\] SCHISM uses this eq. to dynamically adjust the time step for transport for each step. Moreover, to improve efficiency, the vertical flux terms in Eq. \\(\\ref{eq05}\\) are treated implicitly, and the corresponding terms are then removed in the Courant condition - Eq. \\(\\ref{eq07}\\) . This is allowable because upwind is a linear method. TVD (explicit) \u00b6 The only difference between TVD and upwind schemes lies in the evaluation of the interfacial concentration: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq08} C_{j*} = C_{up} + \\frac{\\varphi_j}{2}\\left( C_{jD} - C_{up} \\right) \\end{equation}\\] where \\(C_{up}\\) is given in Eq. \\(\\ref{eq04}\\) , \\(C_{jD}\\) is the downstream concentration, and \\(0 \\leq \\varphi_j \\leq 2\\) is a limiter function. TVD scheme nominally approaches 2nd order accuracy due to the anti-diffusion term. After some algebraic manipulation, the final eq. for TVD is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq09} C_i^{m+1} = C_i + \\frac{\\Delta t'}{V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S^-} \\left| Q_j \\right| (C_j - C_i) + \\frac{\\Delta t'}{V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S} \\left| Q_j \\right| \\frac{\\varphi_j}{2} (C_i - C_j) + \\text{source} + \\text{diffusion} \\end{equation}\\] and the Courant condition is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq10} \\Delta t' \\leq \\frac{V_i}{\\sum_{j\\in S^-}\\left| Q_j \\right| \\left( 1-\\frac{\\varphi_j}{2} + \\delta_i\\right)} \\end{equation}\\] where: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq11} \\delta_i = \\sum_{p\\in S^+} \\frac{\\varphi(r_p)}{2r_p} \\end{equation}\\] and the upwind ratio, which involves upwind of upwind neighboring prism, is given by: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq12} r_p = \\frac{\\sum_{m\\in S^-} \\left| Q_m \\right| (C_m - C_i)}{\\left| Q_p \\right| (C_i - C_p)}, p \\in S^+ \\end{equation}\\] In Eqs. \\(\\ref{eq09}\\) and \\(\\ref{eq10}\\) , the faces \\(S\\) , \\(S^+\\) , and \\(S^-\\) need to exclude the locations where upwind is applied: all horizontal and vertical boundaries, and interfaces between wetting and drying. In those places, \\(\\varphi_j = \\delta_i = 0\\) . Again SCHISM automatically calculates the time step according to the Courant condition (Eq. \\(\\ref{eq10}\\) ); the sub-time step used is the minimum of all prisms. The choices for the limiter function include: MINMOD , OSHER , van Leer , Super Bee etc. Since TVD scheme here is a nonlinear method, we cannot treat the vertical fluxes implicitly, and so all fluxes have to be treated explicitly. TVD method is therefore more expensive than upwind. A more efficient \\(TVD^2\\) using a fractional time step method should be used. \\(TVD^2\\) \u00b6 The TVD scheme shown above is explicit in 3D space and thus subject to the Courant condition, which comprises of horizontal and vertical fluxes across each of the prism faces ( Casulli and Zanolli 2005 ). The restriction related to the vertical fluxes is especially severe due to smaller grid size used in the vertical dimension, and therefore a large number of sub-cycles within each time step are usually required. To partially mitigate the issue, a hybrid upwind-TVD approach can be used in which the more efficient upwind scheme, with an implicit treatment of the vertical fluxes, is used when the flow depth falls below a given threshold (with the assumption that stratification is usually much smaller in the shallows). However, this approach does not work in deeper depths of eddying regime, as large vertical velocities are not uncommon along steep bathymetric slopes. Together with the fact that a large number of vertical levels are usually required in the eddying regime, the explicit scheme leads to subpar computational performance and usually takes over 90% of the total CPU time. We therefore develop an implicit TVD scheme in the vertical dimension in SCHISM. We start from the FVM formulation of the 3D transport equation at a prism \\(i\\) : \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq13} C_i^{n+1} = C_i^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S^-} \\left| Q_j \\right| (C_i - C_j) - \\frac{\\Delta t}{V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S} Q_j C_{jr} + \\frac{A_i \\Delta t}{V_i} \\left[ \\left(\\kappa \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial z} \\right)_{i,k} - \\left(\\kappa \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial z} \\right)_{i, k-1} \\right] + \\frac{\\Delta t}{V_i} \\int_{V_i} F_h dV \\end{equation}\\] where \\(C_j\\) is the concentration at the neighboring prism of \\(i\\) across a prism face \\(j\\in S = S^+ \\cup S^-\\) , with \\(S^+/S^-\\) denoting outflow/inflow faces (which can be horizontal or vertical) respectively, \\(V_i\\) is the prism volume, \\(A_i\\) is the area of the associated surficial element, and \\(Q_j\\) is the flux at a face. In Eq. \\(\\ref{eq13}\\) we have utilized the volume conservation in a prism (which is enforced by the solution of the vertical velocity): \\(\\sum_{j\\in S^-}\\left| Q_j \\right| = \\sum_{j\\in S^+} \\left| Q_j \\right|\\) . We have also approximated the concentration at a face as the sum of an upwind and a correction part as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq14} C\\Biggr|_j = C_{jup} + C_{jr} \\end{equation}\\] Note that in the 2nd term of RHS of Eq. \\(\\ref{eq13}\\) , we have \\(C_j = C_{jup}\\) as \\(j\\) is an inflow face. In addition, we have intentionally left out the time level in some terms in Eq. \\(\\ref{eq13}\\) as they will be treated explicitly or implicitly in the following. We split the solution of Eq. \\(\\ref{eq13}\\) into 3 sub-steps: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq15} C_i^{m+1} = C_i^n + \\frac{\\Delta t_m}{V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S_H^-} \\left| Q_j \\right| (C_j^m - C_i^m) - \\frac{\\Delta t_m}{V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S_H} Q_j \\hat\\psi_j^m, (m = 1, \\cdots, M) \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq16} \\widetilde C_i = C_i^{M+1} + \\frac{\\Delta t}{V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S_V^-} \\left| Q_j \\right| (\\widetilde C_j - \\widetilde C_i) - \\frac{\\Delta t}{V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S_V} Q_j (\\Phi_j + \\Psi_j), (j = kbe+1, \\cdots, N_z) \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq17} C_i^{n+1} = \\widetilde C_i + \\frac{A_i \\Delta t}{V_i} \\left[ \\left( \\kappa \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial z} \\right)_{i,k}^{n+1} - \\left( \\kappa \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial z} \\right)_{i, k-1}^{n+1} \\right] + \\frac{\\Delta t}{V_i} \\int_{V_i} F_h^n dV, (k = kbe+1, \\cdots, N_z) \\end{equation}\\] The 1st step solves the horizontal advection part (for all 3D prisms \\(i\\) ), the 2nd step deals with the vertical advection part (where \\(k_b\\) is the bottom level index and \\(N_z\\) is the surface level index), and the last step tackles the remaining terms. We could have combined the 1st and 3rd steps into a single step at the expense of efficiency, because sub-cycling is used in the 1st step. In Eq. \\(\\ref{eq15}\\) , sub-cylcing in \\(M\\) sub-steps is required because of the horizontal Courant number condition, \\(\\Delta t_m\\) is the sub-time step used, and \\(\\hat\\psi_j^m\\) is a standard TVD limiter function. Eq. \\(\\ref{eq15}\\) is then solved with a standard TVD method. The last step (Eq. \\(\\ref{eq17}\\) ) requires the solution of a simple tri-diagonal matrix. So we will only focus on the 2nd step. Following Duraisamy and Baeder (2007, hereafter DB07) , we use two limiter functions in Eq. \\(\\ref{eq16}\\) : \\(\\Phi_j\\) is the space limiter and \\(\\Psi_j\\) is the time limiter - thus the name \\(TVD^2\\) . The origin of these two limiters is the approximation Eq. \\(\\ref{eq14}\\) via a Taylor expansion in both space and time ( DB07 ): \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq18} \\begin{aligned} C_j^{n+\\frac{1}{2}} &= C_{jup}^{n+1} + \\Phi_j + \\Psi_j\\\\ &= C_{jup}^{n+1} + \\pmb{r}\\cdot\\Bigr[ \\nabla C \\Bigr]_{jup}^{n+1} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\Bigr[ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} \\Bigr]_{jup}^{n+1} \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] Note that the interface value is taken at time level \\(n+\\frac{1}{2}\\) to gain 2nd-order accuracy in time. The vector \\(\\pmb{r}\\) points from prism center \\(jup\\) to face center \\(j\\) . Due to the operator splitting method, \\(C^{n+1}\\) now actually corresponds to \\(\\widetilde{C}\\) . Customary in a TVD method, we then replace the last 2 terms with limiter functions: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq19} C_j^{n+\\frac{1}{2}} = \\widetilde C_{jup} + \\frac{\\phi_j}{2} (\\widetilde C_{jD} - \\widetilde C_{jup}) - \\frac{\\psi_j}{2} (\\widetilde C_{jup} - C_{jup}^{M+1}) \\end{equation}\\] and so: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq20} \\begin{aligned} \\Phi_j = \\frac{\\phi_j}{2} (\\widetilde C_{jD} - \\widetilde C_{jup})\\\\ \\Psi_j = \\frac{\\psi_j}{2} (\\widetilde C_{jup} - C_{jup}^{M+1}) \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] where \u2018jD\u2019 stands for the downwind prism of \\(i\\) along the face \\(j\\) , and \\(\\phi_j\\) and \\(\\psi_j\\) are 2 limiter functions in space and time respectively. Note that \\(\\phi_j = \\psi_j = 1\\) leads to 2nd-order accuracy in both space and time. Substituting Eq. \\(\\ref{eq20}\\) in to Eq. \\(\\ref{eq16}\\) and after some algebra we obtain a nonlinear equation for the unknown concentration: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq21} \\widetilde C_i + \\frac{\\frac{\\Delta t}{V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S_V^-} \\left| Q_j \\right| \\left[ 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sum_{p\\in S_V^+} \\frac{\\phi_p}{r_p} - \\phi_j \\right) \\right] (\\widetilde C_i - \\widetilde C_j)}{1 + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S_V^+} \\left| Q_j \\right| \\left( \\sum_{q\\in S_V^-} \\frac{\\psi_q}{s_q} - \\psi_j \\right)} = C_i^{M+1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(r_p\\) and \\(s_q\\) are upwind and downwind ratios respectively: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq22} \\begin{aligned} r_p &= \\frac{\\sum_{q\\in S_V^-}\\left| Q_q \\right| (\\widetilde C_q - \\widetilde C_i)}{\\left| Q_p \\right| (\\widetilde C_i - \\widetilde C_p)}, p \\in S_V^+\\\\ s_q &= \\frac{(\\widetilde C_i - C_i^{M+1}) \\sum_{p\\in S_V^+} \\left| Q_p \\right|}{\\left| Q_p \\right| (\\widetilde C_q - C_q^{M+1})}, q\\in S_V^- \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] DB07 showed that a sufficient TVD condition for Eq. \\(\\ref{eq21}\\) is that the coefficient of the 2nd LHS term be non-negative, i.e.: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq23} 1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sum_{p\\in S_V^+} \\frac{\\phi_p}{r_p} - \\phi_j \\right) \\geq 0 \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq24} 1 + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S_V^+} \\left| Q_j \\right| \\left( \\sum_{q\\in S_V^-} \\frac{\\psi_q}{s_q} - \\psi_j \\right) \\geq \\delta \\gt 0 \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\delta\\) is a small positive number. Eq. \\(\\ref{eq23}\\) can be satisfied with any choice of standard limiter functions in space, and Eq. \\(\\ref{eq24}\\) must be solved together with Eq. \\(\\ref{eq21}\\) iteratively, because \\(\\psi\\) and \\(s_q\\) are functions of \\(\\widetilde C\\) . We need to discuss 3 scenarios for prism \\(i\\) : Scenario 1. vertically convergent flow: in this case, the outer sum in Eq. \\(\\ref{eq24}\\) is 0, so the inequality is always true; Scenario 2. divergent flow: the numerator of the 2nd LHS term in Eq. \\(\\ref{eq21}\\) is 0, and so \\(\\widetilde C_i = C_i^{M+1}\\) ; Scenario 3. uni-directional flow (either upward or downward): in this case, prism \\(i\\) has exactly 1 inflow and 1 outflow face vertically, so a sufficient condition for Eq. \\(\\ref{eq24}\\) is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq25} 1 - \\frac{\\Delta t}{2 V_i} \\left| Q_j \\right| \\psi_j \\geq \\delta \\gt 0, j\\in S_V^+ \\end{equation}\\] Therefore we choose the following form for the limiter: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq26} \\psi_j = \\text{max}\\left[0, \\text{min}\\left[1, \\frac{2(1-\\delta)V_i}{\\left| Q_j \\right|\\Delta t} \\right] \\right], j\\in S_V^+ \\end{equation}\\] where we have imposed a maximum of 1 in an attempt to obtain 2nd-order accuracy in time. Note that the limiter is a function of the vertical Courant number: it decreases as the Courant number increases. Eqs. \\(\\ref{eq21}\\) and \\(\\ref{eq26}\\) are then solved using a simple Picard iteration method starting from \\(\\psi = 0\\) everywhere, and fast convergence within a few iterations is usually observed. Simple benchmark tests indicate that \\(TVD^2\\) is accurate for a wide range of Courant numbers as found in typical geophysical flows. It works equally well in eddying and non-eddying regimes, from very shallow to very deep depths, and is thus ideal for cross-scale applications. You are encouraged to use this option as much as possible. Third-order WENO scheme \u00b6 This option starts from the same Eqs ( \\(\\ref{eq15}\\) - \\(\\ref{eq17}\\) ), but solves Eq. ( \\(\\ref{eq15}\\) ) using a third-order WENO scheme. Essentially we use a higher-order reconstruction method to approximate the numerical flux and the details can be found in Ye et al. (2019) . Hybridization with Eulerian-Lagrangian Method \u00b6 The FV schemes described above all have explicit component (in the horizontal dimension) that is subject to stability constraint (Courant condition). This constraint can become severe, e.g. with high mesh resolution in the shallows in watershed applications. To alleviate this constaint, SCHISM allows local hybridization between any of the FV schemes and the Eulerian-Lagrangian Method (ELM). Like the ELM scheme used for momentum advection, the ELM scheme for the transport advection is unconditionally stable and monotone (if a linear interpolation is used at the foot of the characteristic line). The only downside of the ELM is that it does not conserve mass in Eulerian sense (but it does in Lagrangian sense), and therefore should be used sparingly, i.e., only to locally speed up the transport solver. The user can invoke this scheme by setting ielm_transport=1 and prescribing a maximum allowed number of sub-sucyclings per time step max_subcyc . To limit the use of ELM only for extreme cases, it's important to set a proper max_subcyc . A rule of thumb is that a sub time step (for the explicit FV sovler) should be around 10 sec, so max_subcyc should be dt/10 . Another issue with this hybridized scheme is that the combination of WENO and ELM in shallows can sometimes lead to large numerical dispersion; see Known issues for details. A simple solution for this issue is to make the affected regions upwind via tvd.prop . Vertical movement \u00b6 Many tracers have \u2018behaviors\u2019 in the form of vertical migration (upward or downward) in the water column. This is modeled with a \u2018settling\u2019 term: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq27} \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\pmb{u}C) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left( \\kappa \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial z} \\right) + \\frac{\\partial (w_s C)}{\\partial z} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(w_s\\) is the settling velocity ( positive downward ). This term is treated implicitly to avoid stability issues; in particular, it\u2019s solved in the 3rd step together with the diffusion term in Eq. \\(\\ref{eq17}\\) . The benefit of this approach is that often the settling term balances the diffusion at boundary (e.g., sediment). Horizontal B.C. for transport \u00b6 In either upwind or TVD schemes, the concentration at the neighboring prism \\(T_j\\) at the open boundary is known. For outflow, \\(T_j=T_i\\) and the signal is advected out of the domain without hindrance. For incoming flow, \\(T_j\\) is specified by the B.C. (either in bctides.in or *.th ), and SCHISM nudges to this value with a relaxation constant (specified in bctides.in ), in order to prevent sharp gradient there. For a complete list of horizontal B.C. supported by SCHISM, see bctides.in . References Casulli, V. and P.

With the upwind scheme, the face concentration is defined as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq04} C_{j*} = \\begin{cases} C_i, j \\in S^+\\\\ C_j, j \\in S^- \\end{cases} \\equiv C_{up} \\end{equation}\\] where we have used shorthand for concentration at prism \\(j\\) (i.e. the prism adjacent to \\((i,k)\\) from face j), and \\(S^+\\) and \\(S^-\\) are outflow and inflow faces respectively. The face concentration take different forms with higher-order schemes. Mass conservation Eq. \\(\\ref{eq03}\\) is the starting point of all FV solvers in SCHISM, from which a conservation statement can be derived. Assuming no zero fluxes at surface, bottom and lateral boundary, summing up over all prisms leads to: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\sum_i V_i C_i^{m+1} = \\sum_i V_i C_i^m - \\Delta t' \\sum_{j\\in FS} Q_j C_j \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(FS\\) stands for free surface. Note that the volume \\(V_i\\) is evaluated at previous step \\(m\\) . The 2nd term in Eq. \\(\\ref{eq03}\\) cancels out at all faces (or vanish at lateral boundary) except at the free surface. The 2nd term in above equation represents the contribution from the surface movement and is supposed to account for the movement from \\(m\\) to \\(m+1\\) . However, this balance is not precise (time truncation error). In the case of \\(TVD^2\\) or \\(WENO\\) ( itr_met>2 ), there is also additional splitting error. Therefore mass conservation is only good up to time truncation error. Retaining only the advection term, Eq. \\(\\ref{eq03}\\) then becomes: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq05} C_i^{m+1} = C_i \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\Delta t'}{V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S^+} \\left| Q_j \\right| \\right) + \\frac{\\Delta t'}{V_i}\\sum_{j\\in S^+} \\left| Q_j \\right| C_j \\end{equation}\\] We have utilized the volume conservation: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq06} \\sum_{j\\in S^+} \\left| Q_j \\right| = \\sum_{j\\in S^-} \\left| Q_j \\right| \\end{equation}\\] Therefore the Courant condition is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq07} 1 - \\frac{\\Delta t'}{V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S^+} \\left| Q_j \\right| \\geq 0 \\end{equation}\\] SCHISM uses this eq. to dynamically adjust the time step for transport for each step. Moreover, to improve efficiency, the vertical flux terms in Eq. \\(\\ref{eq05}\\) are treated implicitly, and the corresponding terms are then removed in the Courant condition - Eq. \\(\\ref{eq07}\\) . This is allowable because upwind is a linear method.","title":"Upwind"},{"location":"schism/transport-equation.html#tvd-explicit","text":"The only difference between TVD and upwind schemes lies in the evaluation of the interfacial concentration: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq08} C_{j*} = C_{up} + \\frac{\\varphi_j}{2}\\left( C_{jD} - C_{up} \\right) \\end{equation}\\] where \\(C_{up}\\) is given in Eq. \\(\\ref{eq04}\\) , \\(C_{jD}\\) is the downstream concentration, and \\(0 \\leq \\varphi_j \\leq 2\\) is a limiter function. TVD scheme nominally approaches 2nd order accuracy due to the anti-diffusion term.

In those places, \\(\\varphi_j = \\delta_i = 0\\) . Again SCHISM automatically calculates the time step according to the Courant condition (Eq. \\(\\ref{eq10}\\) ); the sub-time step used is the minimum of all prisms. The choices for the limiter function include: MINMOD , OSHER , van Leer , Super Bee etc. Since TVD scheme here is a nonlinear method, we cannot treat the vertical fluxes implicitly, and so all fluxes have to be treated explicitly. TVD method is therefore more expensive than upwind. A more efficient \\(TVD^2\\) using a fractional time step method should be used.","title":"TVD (explicit)"},{"location":"schism/transport-equation.html#tvd2","text":"The TVD scheme shown above is explicit in 3D space and thus subject to the Courant condition, which comprises of horizontal and vertical fluxes across each of the prism faces ( Casulli and Zanolli 2005 ). The restriction related to the vertical fluxes is especially severe due to smaller grid size used in the vertical dimension, and therefore a large number of sub-cycles within each time step are usually required. To partially mitigate the issue, a hybrid upwind-TVD approach can be used in which the more efficient upwind scheme, with an implicit treatment of the vertical fluxes, is used when the flow depth falls below a given threshold (with the assumption that stratification is usually much smaller in the shallows). However, this approach does not work in deeper depths of eddying regime, as large vertical velocities are not uncommon along steep bathymetric slopes. Together with the fact that a large number of vertical levels are usually required in the eddying regime, the explicit scheme leads to subpar computational performance and usually takes over 90% of the total CPU time. We therefore develop an implicit TVD scheme in the vertical dimension in SCHISM. We start from the FVM formulation of the 3D transport equation at a prism \\(i\\) : \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq13} C_i^{n+1} = C_i^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S^-} \\left| Q_j \\right| (C_i - C_j) - \\frac{\\Delta t}{V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S} Q_j C_{jr} + \\frac{A_i \\Delta t}{V_i} \\left[ \\left(\\kappa \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial z} \\right)_{i,k} - \\left(\\kappa \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial z} \\right)_{i, k-1} \\right] + \\frac{\\Delta t}{V_i} \\int_{V_i} F_h dV \\end{equation}\\] where \\(C_j\\) is the concentration at the neighboring prism of \\(i\\) across a prism face \\(j\\in S = S^+ \\cup S^-\\) , with \\(S^+/S^-\\) denoting outflow/inflow faces (which can be horizontal or vertical) respectively, \\(V_i\\) is the prism volume, \\(A_i\\) is the area of the associated surficial element, and \\(Q_j\\) is the flux at a face. In Eq. \\(\\ref{eq13}\\) we have utilized the volume conservation in a prism (which is enforced by the solution of the vertical velocity): \\(\\sum_{j\\in S^-}\\left| Q_j \\right| = \\sum_{j\\in S^+} \\left| Q_j \\right|\\) . We have also approximated the concentration at a face as the sum of an upwind and a correction part as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq14} C\\Biggr|_j = C_{jup} + C_{jr} \\end{equation}\\] Note that in the 2nd term of RHS of Eq. \\(\\ref{eq13}\\) , we have \\(C_j = C_{jup}\\) as \\(j\\) is an inflow face. In addition, we have intentionally left out the time level in some terms in Eq. \\(\\ref{eq13}\\) as they will be treated explicitly or implicitly in the following. We split the solution of Eq. \\(\\ref{eq13}\\) into 3 sub-steps: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq15} C_i^{m+1} = C_i^n + \\frac{\\Delta t_m}{V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S_H^-} \\left| Q_j \\right| (C_j^m - C_i^m) - \\frac{\\Delta t_m}{V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S_H} Q_j \\hat\\psi_j^m, (m = 1, \\cdots, M) \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq16} \\widetilde C_i = C_i^{M+1} + \\frac{\\Delta t}{V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S_V^-} \\left| Q_j \\right| (\\widetilde C_j - \\widetilde C_i) - \\frac{\\Delta t}{V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S_V} Q_j (\\Phi_j + \\Psi_j), (j = kbe+1, \\cdots, N_z) \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq17} C_i^{n+1} = \\widetilde C_i + \\frac{A_i \\Delta t}{V_i} \\left[ \\left( \\kappa \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial z} \\right)_{i,k}^{n+1} - \\left( \\kappa \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial z} \\right)_{i, k-1}^{n+1} \\right] + \\frac{\\Delta t}{V_i} \\int_{V_i} F_h^n dV, (k = kbe+1, \\cdots, N_z) \\end{equation}\\] The 1st step solves the horizontal advection part (for all 3D prisms \\(i\\) ), the 2nd step deals with the vertical advection part (where \\(k_b\\) is the bottom level index and \\(N_z\\) is the surface level index), and the last step tackles the remaining terms. We could have combined the 1st and 3rd steps into a single step at the expense of efficiency, because sub-cycling is used in the 1st step. In Eq. \\(\\ref{eq15}\\) , sub-cylcing in \\(M\\) sub-steps is required because of the horizontal Courant number condition, \\(\\Delta t_m\\) is the sub-time step used, and \\(\\hat\\psi_j^m\\) is a standard TVD limiter function. Eq. \\(\\ref{eq15}\\) is then solved with a standard TVD method. The last step (Eq. \\(\\ref{eq17}\\) ) requires the solution of a simple tri-diagonal matrix. So we will only focus on the 2nd step. Following Duraisamy and Baeder (2007, hereafter DB07) , we use two limiter functions in Eq. \\(\\ref{eq16}\\) : \\(\\Phi_j\\) is the space limiter and \\(\\Psi_j\\) is the time limiter - thus the name \\(TVD^2\\) . The origin of these two limiters is the approximation Eq. \\(\\ref{eq14}\\) via a Taylor expansion in both space and time ( DB07 ): \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq18} \\begin{aligned} C_j^{n+\\frac{1}{2}} &= C_{jup}^{n+1} + \\Phi_j + \\Psi_j\\\\ &= C_{jup}^{n+1} + \\pmb{r}\\cdot\\Bigr[ \\nabla C \\Bigr]_{jup}^{n+1} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\Bigr[ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} \\Bigr]_{jup}^{n+1} \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] Note that the interface value is taken at time level \\(n+\\frac{1}{2}\\) to gain 2nd-order accuracy in time. The vector \\(\\pmb{r}\\) points from prism center \\(jup\\) to face center \\(j\\) . Due to the operator splitting method, \\(C^{n+1}\\) now actually corresponds to \\(\\widetilde{C}\\) . Customary in a TVD method, we then replace the last 2 terms with limiter functions: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq19} C_j^{n+\\frac{1}{2}} = \\widetilde C_{jup} + \\frac{\\phi_j}{2} (\\widetilde C_{jD} - \\widetilde C_{jup}) - \\frac{\\psi_j}{2} (\\widetilde C_{jup} - C_{jup}^{M+1}) \\end{equation}\\] and so: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq20} \\begin{aligned} \\Phi_j = \\frac{\\phi_j}{2} (\\widetilde C_{jD} - \\widetilde C_{jup})\\\\ \\Psi_j = \\frac{\\psi_j}{2} (\\widetilde C_{jup} - C_{jup}^{M+1}) \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] where \u2018jD\u2019 stands for the downwind prism of \\(i\\) along the face \\(j\\) , and \\(\\phi_j\\) and \\(\\psi_j\\) are 2 limiter functions in space and time respectively. Note that \\(\\phi_j = \\psi_j = 1\\) leads to 2nd-order accuracy in both space and time. Substituting Eq. \\(\\ref{eq20}\\) in to Eq. \\(\\ref{eq16}\\) and after some algebra we obtain a nonlinear equation for the unknown concentration: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq21} \\widetilde C_i + \\frac{\\frac{\\Delta t}{V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S_V^-} \\left| Q_j \\right| \\left[ 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sum_{p\\in S_V^+} \\frac{\\phi_p}{r_p} - \\phi_j \\right) \\right] (\\widetilde C_i - \\widetilde C_j)}{1 + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S_V^+} \\left| Q_j \\right| \\left( \\sum_{q\\in S_V^-} \\frac{\\psi_q}{s_q} - \\psi_j \\right)} = C_i^{M+1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(r_p\\) and \\(s_q\\) are upwind and downwind ratios respectively: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq22} \\begin{aligned} r_p &= \\frac{\\sum_{q\\in S_V^-}\\left| Q_q \\right| (\\widetilde C_q - \\widetilde C_i)}{\\left| Q_p \\right| (\\widetilde C_i - \\widetilde C_p)}, p \\in S_V^+\\\\ s_q &= \\frac{(\\widetilde C_i - C_i^{M+1}) \\sum_{p\\in S_V^+} \\left| Q_p \\right|}{\\left| Q_p \\right| (\\widetilde C_q - C_q^{M+1})}, q\\in S_V^- \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] DB07 showed that a sufficient TVD condition for Eq. \\(\\ref{eq21}\\) is that the coefficient of the 2nd LHS term be non-negative, i.e.: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq23} 1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sum_{p\\in S_V^+} \\frac{\\phi_p}{r_p} - \\phi_j \\right) \\geq 0 \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq24} 1 + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2V_i} \\sum_{j\\in S_V^+} \\left| Q_j \\right| \\left( \\sum_{q\\in S_V^-} \\frac{\\psi_q}{s_q} - \\psi_j \\right) \\geq \\delta \\gt 0 \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\delta\\) is a small positive number. Eq. \\(\\ref{eq23}\\) can be satisfied with any choice of standard limiter functions in space, and Eq. \\(\\ref{eq24}\\) must be solved together with Eq. \\(\\ref{eq21}\\) iteratively, because \\(\\psi\\) and \\(s_q\\) are functions of \\(\\widetilde C\\) . We need to discuss 3 scenarios for prism \\(i\\) : Scenario 1. vertically convergent flow: in this case, the outer sum in Eq. \\(\\ref{eq24}\\) is 0, so the inequality is always true; Scenario 2. divergent flow: the numerator of the 2nd LHS term in Eq. \\(\\ref{eq21}\\) is 0, and so \\(\\widetilde C_i = C_i^{M+1}\\) ; Scenario 3. uni-directional flow (either upward or downward): in this case, prism \\(i\\) has exactly 1 inflow and 1 outflow face vertically, so a sufficient condition for Eq. \\(\\ref{eq24}\\) is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq25} 1 - \\frac{\\Delta t}{2 V_i} \\left| Q_j \\right| \\psi_j \\geq \\delta \\gt 0, j\\in S_V^+ \\end{equation}\\] Therefore we choose the following form for the limiter: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq26} \\psi_j = \\text{max}\\left[0, \\text{min}\\left[1, \\frac{2(1-\\delta)V_i}{\\left| Q_j \\right|\\Delta t} \\right] \\right], j\\in S_V^+ \\end{equation}\\] where we have imposed a maximum of 1 in an attempt to obtain 2nd-order accuracy in time. Note that the limiter is a function of the vertical Courant number: it decreases as the Courant number increases. Eqs. \\(\\ref{eq21}\\) and \\(\\ref{eq26}\\) are then solved using a simple Picard iteration method starting from \\(\\psi = 0\\) everywhere, and fast convergence within a few iterations is usually observed. Simple benchmark tests indicate that \\(TVD^2\\) is accurate for a wide range of Courant numbers as found in typical geophysical flows. It works equally well in eddying and non-eddying regimes, from very shallow to very deep depths, and is thus ideal for cross-scale applications.

This constraint can become severe, e.g. with high mesh resolution in the shallows in watershed applications. To alleviate this constaint, SCHISM allows local hybridization between any of the FV schemes and the Eulerian-Lagrangian Method (ELM). Like the ELM scheme used for momentum advection, the ELM scheme for the transport advection is unconditionally stable and monotone (if a linear interpolation is used at the foot of the characteristic line). The only downside of the ELM is that it does not conserve mass in Eulerian sense (but it does in Lagrangian sense), and therefore should be used sparingly, i.e., only to locally speed up the transport solver. The user can invoke this scheme by setting ielm_transport=1 and prescribing a maximum allowed number of sub-sucyclings per time step max_subcyc . To limit the use of ELM only for extreme cases, it's important to set a proper max_subcyc . A rule of thumb is that a sub time step (for the explicit FV sovler) should be around 10 sec, so max_subcyc should be dt/10 . Another issue with this hybridized scheme is that the combination of WENO and ELM in shallows can sometimes lead to large numerical dispersion; see Known issues for details.

An important aspect of this update is the treatment of inundation (wetting/drying). SCHISM supports 2 options for inundation. Note that the elevations are solved at all nodes including dry nodes at the previous time step; in other words, the elevations at the dry nodes \u2013 they are simply below the local bottom and can be thought as inactive ground water. The 1st option ( inunfl=0 ) is the default one that should be used in most applications. It uses a simple book-keeping algorithm to mark node/side/element as wet/dry based on a threshold depth ( h0 ). SCHISM does not support partial wetting and drying, and so the rule inside the code is: an element is wet if all of its nodes and sides are wet, and is dry if any of its nodes or sides becomes dry. A node/side is wet iff (if and only if) at least 1 of its surrounding element is wet. For newly rewetted element/node/side, some state variables may be re-initialized based wet neighbors. The 2nd option ( inunfl=1 ) uses a shoreline tracking algorithm which requires finer resolution to be effective; otherwise the extrapolation procedure below may over-predict the inundation. In realistic cases, <5m resolution is usually sufficient for this purpose. Starting from the shoreline position at step \\(n\\) , each node on this line is checked for wetting and drying, and the local portion of the line is updated accordingly (Figure 1 ). The process is iterative and multi-layer wetting and drying is possible. After the new shoreline position is found at step \\(n+1\\) ,a constant extrapolation of surface elevation is used from this position projected onto the nearest \u2018dry\u2019 node, in order to enhance the stability of the wetting and drying front (a technique advocated by the tsunami MOST model). Shoreline tracking algorithm. (a) The orange line is the shoreline from step n, and the light blue line is the updated portion since A is wetted and B becomes dry at step n+1. (b) At the end of the tracking, constant extrapolation of elevation is used at the new shoreline position, which may flood the next dry node.","title":"Updating the levels/Inundation"},{"location":"schism/vertical-velocity.html","text":"The vertical velocity serves as a diagnostic variable for local volume conservation 1 , but is a physically important quantity, especially when a steep slope is present ( Zhang et al. 2004 ).
