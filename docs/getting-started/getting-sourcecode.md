SCHISM modeling system is mostly distributed via github. To download the source code it is good idea to have `git` installed in your system. If you have git, you can download the sourcecode with the following commands - 

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/schism-dev/schism.git
cd schism
```

This will give you the latest master branch and all submodules inside (e.g. GOTM5). If you want to get certain tagged versions use the `tag` command of git as (for example) `git checkout tags/v5.10.0` - for v5.10.0.

Note that sometimes you might need to add your systemâ€™s ssh public key to your github.com account first before cloning. 
If cloning fails, you can also go to https://github.com/schism-dev and directly download the zip files.

General users have access to all branches and tags  of the repository (https://github.com/schism-dev/schism). You can find online manuals for the latest stable
 master or newer tags after v5.9.0. The developers will constantly update the manuals to keep them up to date as much as possible.
