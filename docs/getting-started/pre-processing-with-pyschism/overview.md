 a few pre-selected atmospheric models ([ERA5](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5), [GFS](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-gfs-bdp-pds/), and [HRRR](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-hrrr-pds/)). PySCHISM has its own [repository](https://github.com/schism-dev/pyschism).
