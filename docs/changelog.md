Up to date information on bug fixes/major algorithmic changes, as well as changes in input/output formats can be found in source bundle: src/Readme.beta_notes.

In particular, errors when hopping among versions can be fixed by referring to src/Readme.beta_notes. 
 E.g, new mandatory (CORE) parameters in `param.nml` are found by searching for 'mandatory' in this file. Obsolete optional parameters
 are found by searching for 'removed'. You do not need to worry about newly introduced  optional parameters as the model
 will set default for you.
