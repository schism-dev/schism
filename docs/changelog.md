## Bug fixes and major algorithmic changes
91. `R5178`: fix bug of saturate `DO` in [ICM](modules/icm.md)
92. `R5187`: incorporated dry bnd treatment from bndry (c/o Jens Wyrwa). However, to get good volume conservation it's best to keep all open flow bnd's wet all the time as before;
93. `R5191`: fixed a bug in `iwind_form` (accidentally re-init'ed after reading);
94. `R5202`: fixed a bug on negative ICM tracer concentration - check negative values before sending back to hydro.
95. `R5204`: a new option to control behavior of `btrack` when trajectory hots an open bnd (set `vel=0` and exit). Goal is to eventually use this as default;
96. [`64b7181`](https://github.com/schism-dev/schism/commit/64b7181): fixed an efficiency issue and added nc checks in `ptrack3` (c/o Marcel Rieker)
97. [`2138e77`](https://github.com/schism-dev/schism/commit/2138e77): Fixed a major bug introduced during reshuffling of `_init` for PDAF: need to call `nodavel` before sflux, as uu2,vv20 are needed there.
98. [`5ff2198`](https://github.com/schism-dev/schism/commit/5ff2198): revamped [AGE](modules/age.md) module. B.C. now all should use 0. Only 0 and 1 should be used in `AGE_hvar_[1:ntr/2].ic`, where ntr is @ of age tracers, and the code will 'hold' concentration at 1 at those prisms (level specified in param.nml) that have 1 as i.c. I.C. in `AGE_hvar_[ntr/2+1:ntr].ic` should `=0`. Injecting '1' at dry elem's is allowed but results may be harder to interpret.
99. [`6cec698`](https://github.com/schism-dev/schism/commit/6cec698): bug fix for spherical coord in [WWM](modules/wwm.md) (around dateline);
100. [`c46c7bd`](https://github.com/schism-dev/schism/commit/c46c7bd) (Feb 14, 2020): Fei tweaked WENO solver (wrt upwind);
101. [`d3adb2c`](https://github.com/schism-dev/schism/commit/d3adb2c) (Feb 14, 2020): changed to bilinear interp for HYCOM hot and nudging scripts (to speed up);
102. [`7506147`](https://github.com/schism-dev/schism/commit/7506147) (Mar 1, 2020): add limiter for settling vel to avoid char line out of bnd;
103. [`5665418`](https://github.com/schism-dev/schism/commit/5665418) (Mar 18, 2020): PR from Baptiste mengual for [SED3D](modules/sed3d.md) (`sed_frition.F90` merged after the rest).

[`55910d1`](https://github.com/schism-dev/schism/commit/55910d1) (July 31, 2020; via branch mem_leak_nc4): reverted the change in schism_io (close/open nc output after/b4 each write, to accommodate PDAF's flexible mode), as this has caused a lot of mem leaking (discovered by Nicole C. when testing ICM).
111. [`eaf9093`](https://github.com/schism-dev/schism/commit/eaf9093) (Aug 2020): Baptiste M. modified the computation of the bottom shear stress under combined waves and currents in SED3D

    - Changes in WWM .nml: `ALPBJ ->B_ALP`, `BRHD->BRCR`.
- [`8083cfa`](https://github.com/schism-dev/schism/commit/8083cfa) (Nov. 10, 2020): added option for offline transport solver only ('itransport_only');
- [`7e9ff0a`](https://github.com/schism-dev/schism/commit/7e9ff0a) (Aug 20, 2020): added two options (selected by `i_hmin_airsea_ex`) for locally turning off heat/salt exchange.
    - `i_hmin_airsea_ex=1`: exchange turned off if local grid depth<hmin_airsea_ex;
    - `i_hmin_airsea_ex=2`: exchange turned off if local water depth<hmin_airsea_ex
    - This replaces the change made by [`adde1aa`](https://github.com/schism-dev/schism/commit/adde1aa) (July 8, 2020): added a new parameter `hmin_airsea_ex` (min total water depth for heat/salt exchange);
- [`2f7bab1`](https://github.com/schism-dev/schism/commit/2f7bab1) (Jun 28,2020): reorganized ICM process (rates/fluxes) and added output flag in `param.nml`.
- [`1477780`](https://github.com/schism-dev/schism/commit/1477780) (May 8, 2020): changed `sediment.in` to sediment.nml. 
    - `BEDLOAD_COEFF` $\rightarrow$ `bedload_coeff`, `NEWLAYER_THICK` $\rightarrow$ `newlayer_thick`, `IMETH_BED_EVOL` $\rightarrow$ `imeth_bed_evol`
    - `SAND_SD50` $\rightarrow$ `Sd50`, `SAND_ERATE` $\rightarrow$ `Erate`, `SED_TYPE` $\rightarrow$ `iSedtype`, `SAND_SRHO` $\rightarrow$ `Srho`, `SAND_WSED` $\rightarrow$ `Wsed`, `SAND_TAU_CE` $\rightarrow$ `tau_ce`, `sed_morph_fac` $\rightarrow$ `morph_fac`, `poro_cst` $\rightarrow$ `porosity`);
