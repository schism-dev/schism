Under this module the user can output several internal arrays inside the code, and this is useful for detailed analysis like momentum and tracer budget etc. We have implemented some commonly requested terms in the momentum and transport equations, which can be found in the code by searching for `_ANALYSIS` and also in `param.nml` under `iof_ana`. The user can also use this module to output additional terms if they are familiar with the source code. Note that invoking this module may slow down the code.
