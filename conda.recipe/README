# This is the recipe for conda.

## Files:

**meta.yaml** : conda config

**build.sh** : Bash script for compiling based on `CMake`.

**conda\_build\_config.yaml** : Used for defining various variants.

## Procedure:

Set the options in `conda_build_config.yaml`.

Note that having both false/true in the options would create all combinations.

It's better if the binaries are then differenciated by adding in the `meta.yaml` file the variable to the name definition e.g.

```python
  name: {{ name|lower }}-{{ TVD_LIM|lower }}
```

Edit `meta.yaml` file setting

 - version

```python
{% set version = "5.9" %}
```

 - branch

```python
  git_tag: v5.9
```

Make sure that you have `conda-build` and `conda-verify` in your env. You can use

`conda install conda-build conda-verify`

Build by executing from the folder containing the *conda.recipe* folder:

`conda build conda.recipe`
