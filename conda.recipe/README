# This are the recipe files for conda.

There are 2 ways to compile: 

1. Based on a Makefile. The build_mk.sh script creates the Makefile and compiles it. This is the approached used currently.

2. Based on CMake. It compiles better that the Makefile but for some reason I couldn't get it to work within conda. It should be checked again. The build_vl.sh script is used for this and it should be replaced in the meta.yaml file. 

## Files:

meta.yaml : conda config

build_mk.sh : Bash script for compiling based on Makefile.

build_vl.sh : Bash script for compiling based on CMake.

conda_build_config.yaml_: Used for testing. Probably not needed.

cross-linux.cmake : used in build_vl.sh.


## Procedure:

`conda build conda.recipe`
