set (USE_GOTM OFF CACHE BOOLEAN "Use GOTM turbulence model")


##########################  LOCATIONS #########################################################
#
# LOCATIONS: Set locations for NetCDF (possibly HDF5 if NetCDF links to it), ParMetis, PETSc
#            You don't need to set these if they are in your environment
#
#            Only the library home location is needed and the /lib or /bin part will be inferred.
#            Generally traditional structure is assumed, but the Parmetis and GOTM libraries
#            that are included have a slightly different structure
#
#            You only need PETSc for WWM
#            You only need GOTM if you intend to use it with USE_GOTM
#            GOTM and ParMetis local copies will be found automatically, but also can overridden
#            You have to build them

######################## COMPILE AND BUILD OPTIONS ##############################################
#
# BUILD OPTS: Use this to set compiler flags any way you want.For models of how to set flags, 
#             see SELFECompile.cmake, which are the project defaults.
#
#             If you are setting up a new platform/compiler combo rather than customizing, 
#             you might consider adding to SELFECompile.cmake with the correct "IF" so 
#             others can profit from your work.
#             
#             If what you are doing is debugging, consider using -DBUILD_TYPE=Debug and using the default
#             debug flags. Note that there is yet another build type for release plus symbols.
#
#             So far I have removed -Bstatic because it is causes problems and cmake seems to do enough
#             magically.
