! !ROUTINE: init_dim_obs_pdaf --- Compute number of observations
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE init_dim_obs_pdaf(step, dim_obs_p)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! User-supplied routine for PDAF.
! Used in the filters: SEEK/SEIK/EnKF/ETKF/ESTKF
!
! The routine is called at the beginning of each
! analysis step.  It has to initialize the size of 
! the observation vector according to the current 
! time step for the PE-local domain.
!
! The routine is called by all filter processes.
!
! !REVISION HISTORY:
! 2004-10 - Lars Nerger - Initial code
! Later revisions - see svn log
!
! !USES:
  IMPLICIT NONE

! !ARGUMENTS:
  INTEGER, INTENT(in)  :: step       ! Current time step
  INTEGER, INTENT(out) :: dim_obs_p  ! Dimension of observation vector

! !CALLING SEQUENCE:
! Called by: PDAF_seek_analysis    (as U_init_dim_obs)
! Called by: PDAF_seik_analysis, PDAF_seik_analysis_newT
