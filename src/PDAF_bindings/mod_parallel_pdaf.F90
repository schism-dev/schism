! !MODULE:
MODULE mod_parallel_pdaf

! !DESCRIPTION:
! This modules provides variables for the MPI parallelization
! to be shared between model-related routines. These are variables
! that are used in the model, even without PDAF and additional
! variables that are only used, if data assimialtion with PDAF
! is performed.
! In addition methods to initialize and finalize MPI are provided.
! The initialization routine is only for the model itself, the 
! more complex initialization of communicators for xecution with
! PDAF is peformed in init\_parallel\_pdaf.
!
! !REVISION HISTORY:
! 2004-10 - Lars Nerger - Initial code
! Later revisions - see svn log

! !PUBLIC DATA MEMBERS:
  ! Additional variables for use with PDAF
  INTEGER :: n_modeltasks = 1         ! Number of parallel model tasks
  INTEGER :: n_filterpes  = 1         ! Number of PEs for filter analysis
  INTEGER :: COMM_filter ! MPI communicator for filter PEs 
  INTEGER :: mype_filter, npes_filter ! # PEs and PE rank in COMM_filter
  INTEGER :: COMM_couple ! MPI communicator for coupling filter and model
  LOGICAL :: modelpe     ! Whether we are on a PE in a COMM_model
  LOGICAL :: filterpe    ! Whether we are on a PE in a COMM_filter
  INTEGER :: task_id     ! Index of my model task (1,...,n_modeltasks)
  INTEGER :: MPIerr      ! Error flag for MPI
  INTEGER :: MPIstatus(MPI_STATUS_SIZE)       ! Status array for MPI
  INTEGER, ALLOCATABLE :: local_npes_model(:) ! # PEs per ensemble
