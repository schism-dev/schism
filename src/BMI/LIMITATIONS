# Current Limitations to SCHISM BMI and Future Work

1. MPI parallelization is partially implemented for SCHISM driven
through BMI. Before calling the BMI initialize routine, the MPI
Communicator for SCHISM to use can be set in the integer variable
`bmi_mpi_comm_handle`

2. Water level and source/sink connectors have not been fully
validated yet for SCHISM.
