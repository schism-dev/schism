Scripts for making river arcs from DEMs for meshes used in compound flooding simulations. 

Installation (python 3.9 or above is recommended):
pip install git+https://github.com/schism-dev/schism.git#subdirectory=src/Utility/Grid_Scripts/Compound_flooding/RiverMapper
You may need to manually install gdal (e.g., conda install gdal) if there is an error with it, then redo the above 'pip' command.

Sample applications (download link):

Use the command 'tar xvf RiverMapper_Samples.tar' to extract files from the \*.tar file

See online documentation in the [SCHISM manual](https://schism-dev.github.io/schism/master/mesh-generation/meshing-for-compound-floods/overview.html) for more information.
