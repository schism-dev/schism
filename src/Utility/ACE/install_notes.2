(0) Notes and troubleshooting
    You may need to  increase MAXBOUNDS and MAXGRIDBOUNDS in xmvis6/defines.h and xmgredit5/defines
    for very lange grid.

    xmvis6 xmgredit5 errors:
      /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lXp
      Edit xmvis6/Makefile and remove "-lXp" from LIBS variable in line 33


      If the make causes a problem, do:
      rm gram.c gram.h 
      This is related to bison parsing util

(1) Install sequence:
    elio
    lib
    xmgredit5
    xmvis6
    xmgr5

(2) needs libs: 
    X11 pixmap library                libxpm-dev
    X11 client-side library           libx11-6
    Motif - X/Motif shared library:   libxm4
    X11 miscellaneous utility library libxmu-dev
    Motif - development files         libmotif-dev
    GD Graphics Library version 2:    libgd-dev. Don't use the version in lib/graphics its too old

    xmgr5 may also need postgres, netcdf (comment out in Makefile if not needed)

(3) Install steps on linux:
   Compile libraries
   cd ACE/
   cd elio/
   make
   cd ../lib
   make
   cd ..
   cp lib/fli/libfpp.a lib/
   cp elio/libelio.a lib/ 
   mkdir include
   cp lib/fli/fpfli.h include/
   cp ../elio/elio.h include/
   cd ..

   Compile xmgredit5
   cd xmgredit5/ 
   make
   cd ..

   Compile xmvis6
    cd /xmvis6/ 
    make clean
    make

   Compile xmgr5
     cd ../xmgr5
     rm -f pars.c pars.h 
     make pars.c (generate new pars.c with bison)
     vi Makefile (make sure NETCDF and PGSQL are commented out)
     make clean
     make

(4) The steps above can be followed for windows running cygwin and a X server (Xming, Exceed etc).
    You need to do a FULL installation of cygwin (with all packages).
