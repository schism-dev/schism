Recommended usage:

1) "cp -rL" the current dir ("Sflux2Source/") to your run dir and see usage in the first few lines of following script:
  sflux2source.m
  merge_source_sink.m


2) sflux2source.m:
  Convert precipitation from sflux to volume source, see usage in the beginning of the script.


3) merge_source_sink.m:
  Merge two sets of source/sink files:
    <Original source/sink, e.g. from NWM>
      source_sink.in.1
      vsource.th.1
      msource.th.1
      vsink.th.1
    <source/sink converted from sflux>
      source_sink.in.2
      vsource.th.2
      msource.th.2
      (no sinks, because evaporation is not included)
  See usage in the beginning of the script.


4) move the final outputs:
      source_sink.in
      vsource.th
      msource.th
      vsink.th
  into your run dir.

5) Visualize final outputs using viz_source.m. See usage in the beginning of the script.
