This file contains the steps making NWM_shp_ll.nc, a input file required by coupling_nwm.f90

1 download the geo-database (gdb) package, NWM_channel_hydrofabric.tar.gz, from NWM website:
http://www.nohrsc.noaa.gov/pub/staff/keicher/NWM_live/web/data_tools/NWM_channel_hydrofabric.tar.gz

2 Open the gdb using ArcGIS and add the nwm_reaches_conus to the map layer
 
3 Use "Feature Vertices to Points" tool convert the stream feature to point feature class
(convert the whole area will be too large and trigger issue in ArcGIS, you may want to clip and save the segments only for the area you are interested)

4 Then use "Feature to NetCDF" tool to write lat, lon, ORIG_FID, and FeatureID into netcdf file and name it as NWM_shp_ll.nc
