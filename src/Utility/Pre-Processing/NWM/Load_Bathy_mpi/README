Loading DEMs to horizontal grid:
1)You need have DEM tiles ready. On sciclone or james, you can find them under:
# sample: $DEM_dir = '/ches/data10/whuang07/Case1/DEMs/DEM_pre/DEM/';
# sample: $DEM_dir = '/sciclone/data10/whuang07/NWM/DEM/DEM/';

2)you need have a input hgrid.old: the old hgrid.gr3 that the DEMs to be loaded, note that the projection must be lat/lon

3)All DEMs should be linked under the current DEM folder

4) Follow the steps below:
  0 interpolate DEM/etopo1.asc to hgrid.old
  1 cd DEM, run sym*_part1.pl.
  2 cd ../
  3 ln -sf DEM/dem_*.asc .
  4 edit dems.in, the first number is the total number of dem_*.asc
    the second number is the total nodes you want to use.
  5 submit run_james
  6 mv hgrid.new hgrid.old
  7 then repeat step 1 with sym*_part2.pl
  8 repeat steps from 2-5
  9 use "./auto_edit_region 1 dummy.reg hgrid.new -10" to set the minimum depth to be -10m
  10 mv out.gr3 hgrid.new
  11 use "./auto_edit_region 1 min_5m_ll.reg hgrid.new 5" to set the depth inside region (min_5m_ll.reg) to be 5m
  12 mv out.gr3 hgrid.new
  13 your hgrid.new will be the final one with all DEMs loaded.

  or ./auto.pl (see comments inside; not tested on Stampede2)
  This step only needs to edit the path of DEM tiles and put the hgrid.ll (hgrid needs to be loaded bathymetry) to upper level directory
