1. Clima/Dai_Trenberth/ 
       gen_clima.py generate hourly data 


2. NWM/
   a. subset_hgrid.py: generate subgrid for conus, hawaii, alaska to avoid shapely.errors.topologicalerror caused by hull from [-180, 180)
       outputs: local_to_global_{conus, alaska, hawaii}.json - map subgrid elment id to global element id
                hgrid_sub_convert_lon_{conus, alaska, hawaii}.gr3 - [-180, 180)

   b. gen_sourcesink_json.py: generate sources_{conus, alaska, hawaii}.json and sinks_{conus, alaska, hawaii}.json
   
   c. map_local_to_global.py: map sub_grid element id to global element id, and remove elements near willamette/columbia river
      outputs: sources_{conus, alaska, hawaii}_global.json
               sinks_{conus, alaska, hawaii}_global.json
               (may need to manually delete null values)

   d. Combined/
      gen_sourcesink.py: combine Dai&Trenberth data, and NWM, then write source/sink files
         inputs: sources_{conus, alaska, hawaii}_global.json
                 sinks_{conus, alaska, hawaii}_global.json
                 cached/nwm_*_{conus, alaska, hawaii}.nc

3. GLOFAS/
   For newer version of the forecast, GLOFAS replaces Dai and Trenberth climatology.
   If GLOFAS and NWM are being used in combination, then region files covering the NWM regions should be provided to process_GLOFAS_sourcesink_fcast_daily.py to exclude overlapping GLOFAS sources.
   a. process_GLOFAS_sourcesink_fcast_preprocess.py: uses hgrid.gr3 and GLOFAS static file uparea_glofas_v4_0.nc to generate the indices from GLOFAS grid to use for extraction from data file, writes to 'preproc-glofas.npz', tested using shapely 2.0.7, rasterio 1.4, pylibs-ocean 1.2.2

   b. process_GLOFAS_sourcesink_fcast_daily.py: uses 'preproc-glofas.npz' information plus a CDS API key to download daily GLOFAS forecasts from ECMWF, generates source_sink.in and vsource.th and msource.th, merges inputs where multiple rivers enter in the same element, doesn't apply flow/volume ratio cutoff for elements, so redistribute_source_new.f90 needs to be run after this step, uses pylibs-ocean only to read .reg files and inside_polygon function. Uses cdsapi 0.7.5., API key is expected in ~/.cdsapirc, but can be supplied as argument to cdsapi.Client() or as environment variable. data source url is specified in code.
  
   c. lewis_larger.reg: GLOFAS sources near river boundaries are automatically removed, but region files can be specified to exclude additional GLOFAS sources. In the NEW22 version of the Pacific model grid, the Lewis River (Columbia R. tributary) open boundary does not match the Lewis location in GLOFAS, so this region file is used to prevent double counting the Lewis River.
