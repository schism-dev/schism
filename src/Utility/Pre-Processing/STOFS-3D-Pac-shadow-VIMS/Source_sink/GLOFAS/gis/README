**GIS/ files **
used by process_GLOFAS_sourcesink_fcast_preprocess.py
1) static files for GloFAS preprocessing
  a) HydroRIVERS_v10_pacifiic_last200km_upland100km2_wEndorheic.shp: WWF HydroSHEDS dataset: https://www.hydrosheds.org/ v1, subset to last 200km from river ends and rivers larger than 100km^2 watershed along the Pacific model boundary, includes endorheic rivers
  b) uparea_glofas_v4_0.nc: GloFAS static file: https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CEMS/Auxiliary+Data, upriver watershed area for each cell, used to determine river ends and cutoff values for inclusion
2) region files
  a) cowlitz_larger.reg, lewis_larger.reg : Two tributary rivers handled through open bounds and USGS observation data, excluded from GloFAS processing
  b) no_alsea_wo_fix.reg : small river that enters along the Oregon coast where bathymetry in NEW23 has wetting and drying, excluding from the current version of model, will fix bathymetry in future grid version
  c) test_ORWA.reg: purely for testing purposes, use this as an argument with -r to test commande line exclusion areas, replace with NWM exclusion area is combining GloFAS and NWM inputs
3) hgrid.gr3 or hgrid.npz (can also be stored in a separate location (grid location is a separate argument to the python script
