**python scripts**
python scripts use argparse, so --help will show list of arguments

1) download_GLOFAS.py                              run daily to download data from Copernicus, uses cdsapi, requires CDS personal key in home directory (or as argument in code) 
							wildly variable runtime (seconds to hours) depending on server responsiveness
2) process_GLOFAS_sourcesink_fcast_daily.py        run daily to process downloaded data into source_sink.in, vsource.th, msource.th, outputs need to be run through redistribute_source.f90

**slurm scripts**
1) forecast.sh                           runs all the .sub jobs in sequence
2) glofasdownload.sub                    download current day glofas file  (uses glofasdownload conda environment)
3) glofasdaily.sub                       dynamic processing of download glofas file for current day (uses glofasdaily conda envirnoment)
4) source_sink/redist_source.sub       redistributes the sources if they exceed the discharge/volume ratio, creating source_sink.in, vsource.th and msource.th (with -999 values)


**directories**
prep/               contains glofas_prep.npz file needed for glofasdaily.sub (given as an argument to process_GLOFAS_sourcesink_fcast_daily.py)
download/           download file location  (given as an argument to download_GLOFAS.py)
source_sink/       contains source sink redistribution process  (specified in glofasdaily.sub as location to copy output files)

**conda environments**
envs/ contains yaml manifests
glofasdownload:        cdsapi (installed with pip)
glofasdaily:           numpy, netCDF4

**fortran code**
source_sink/redistribute_source.f90     standard version from  schism/src/Utility/Pre-Processing/

**static files**
prep/glofas_prep.npz                     specifies locations at which to extract from GloFAS, and mapping to grid elements 
source_sink/redistribute_source.in      specifies the regions to exclude from redistributing sources based on discharge/volume ratios  (redistribute not applied in estuaries and rivers)
hgrid.gr3                                (needed for redistribute code)

**generated files**
download/GLOFAS-global-today.nc            daily download of glofas data
redistribute/
      source_sink.in, vsource.th, msource.th      standard input files  
      source_sink.in.0, vsource.th.0              standard input files before redistribution
      vsource.bp.0                                source mean fluxes at locations in .bp format for sanity checking/visualization
