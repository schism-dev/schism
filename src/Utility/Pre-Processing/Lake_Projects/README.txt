SMS maps and other info for lake projects.
1. Superior_Wei_v8.map
     Comments: this map is the most updated map with a focus on Duluth Harbor. It also resolves all the major harbors around Lake Superior and incorporated with new changes from Josh's mesh.
     Important maps included in this map file are:
     	1) Superior_v6_10m previous version
	2) Load_depth_1: used for generating a separate mesh to load bathymetry for barrier islands around Duluth Harbor (-2m) and some Nemadji river channel (0.5m), the gr3 file generated using this mesh is called /sciclone/home20/whuang07/schism10/GreatLakes/Grid/v9/Depth_regions_1.gr3
	3) Load_depth_2: used for generating a separate mesh to load bathymetry for Duluth Harbor, bathymetry is obtained from Navigational Chart, the gr3 file generated using this mesh is called /sciclone/home20/whuang07/schism10/GreatLakes/Grid/v9/Depth_regions_from_NVChart.ll
	The method for generating this map is to generate a buffered polygon using the existing feature arcs with 0m contour.
	Depth are scattered points manually specified based on the Navigational chart.
     	4) Superior_v6_10m_dup: excluding Duluth Harbor, a previous map used to generate Superior_v7_10m_0
	5) Superior_v7_10m_0: a map with focus on Duluth Harbor, without merging NWM streams
	6) NWM_streams_5: NWM streams with 4 cross channel elements, 5 parallel lines
	7) Harbors: several other harbors are resolved by this map
	8) Stream_buffer_60m: used for generating a separate mesh to edit bathymetry along NWM streams (depression is 2m)
	The gr3 file is /sciclone/home20/whuang07/schism10/GreatLakes/Grid/v9/Depth_regions_3_streams2m.ll
	9) Superior_v7_10m_with_NWM: final version of Superior_v7 (a previous version)
	10) Superior_v7_10m_0_dup: a duplicate of Superior_v7_10m_0 with changes, the changes is made to merge the new changes from the mesh by Josh/Chin
	11) Superior_from_Josh: obtained from Josh/Chin (original without changes)
	12 Superior_from_Josh_dup: a duplicate of Superior_from_Josh, prepared to be merged with Superior_v7_10m_0_dup
	13) Superior_v8_10m_0=Superior_from_Josh_dup+Superior_v7_10m_0_dup_Harbors, a mesh merged incorporating Josh's mesh and the previous version (v7), before merging NWM streams
        14) Superior_v8_10m_withNWM: Final map including NWM streams

2. FiveLakes_Wei_v2.map
	This map is the SMS map for five lakes, Superior Lake map is consistent with the one in Superior_Wei_v8.map
	1) Superior_v8_10m_0: same with the one in Superior_Wei_v8.map
	2) Superior_v8_10m_withNWM: same with the one in Superior_Wei_v8.map
	3) Erie_10m_1: Lake Erie
	4) Ontaria_10m_1: Ontaria Lake
	5) Huron_Mi_10m: Huron and Michigan lakes, deeper water arcs are used for constrain number of nodes, guidance is the mesh from Chin's group
	6) NWM_streams_0: NWM arcs with resolution of 150m
	7) NWM_streams_1_150m: 4 elements 5 parallel lines generated by ArcPro using NWM_streams_0
	8) NWM_stream_0_poly_500m: arcs bounding the NWM_streams_0 with 500m resolution, 300m away from the NWM_streams_0 arcs
	9) NWM_streams_with_500mPoly = NWM_streams_1_150m + NWM_stream_0_poly_500m
	10) Superior_v8_10m_0_dup
	11) GreatLake_0_dup
	12) GreatLake_1_noNWM = GreatLake_0_dup + Superior_v8_10m_0_dup
	13) GreatLake_1_withNWM = GreatLake_1_noNWM + NWM_streams_with_500mPoly

Steps for loading bathymetry
1. loading bathymetry for Superior_Wei_v8.ll
	1) Load ascii file from dir below: (script: /sciclone/home20/whuang07/schism10/GreatLakes/Grid/v9/load_asc.pl)
        (fortran script used in the load_asc.pl is an older version of fortran script:
        schism/src/Utility/Grid_Scripts/interpolate_depth_structured2.f90)
	/sciclone/home20/whuang07/schism10/GreatLakes/DEM/ascii/
	superior_lld.asc
	dem_3m_above0m_ldw_ll.asc
	slre_bath_limnotech_lwd.asc
	gl_2007_lwd_1m.asc
	usace2011_greatlakes_dem_ll_3m_lwd.asc
	usace2019_superior_dem_ll_3m_lwd.asc
	usace2019_superior_dem_ll_3m_lwd_stmarys.asc
	wi2009_bayfieldcounty_lakesuperior_3m_ll_lwd.asc
	wi2016_bafield_ll_lwd.asc
	2) Load bathy from separate mesh using gred:
	/sciclone/home20/whuang07/schism10/GreatLakes/Grid/v5/Depth_regions_from_NVChart.ll
	3) Load depth from another separate mesh using gred:
	/sciclone/home20/whuang07/schism10/GreatLakes/Grid/v3/Depth_regions_1.gr3
	4) Edit depth for jetties at mouth of Duluth Harbor to be -2m, the grid now has name of hgrid.new
	5) Set the depth at all nodes to be 0, then load depth from another separate mesh as below using xmgredit5, save the hgrid to be hgrid.NWM
	/sciclone/home20/whuang07/schism10/GreatLakes/Grid/v9/Depth_regions_3_streams2m.ll
	6) Use script by Joseph for linearly adding the two grids so that the river channels can have 2m of depression
	The resulted grid will be the final grid with depth loaded
