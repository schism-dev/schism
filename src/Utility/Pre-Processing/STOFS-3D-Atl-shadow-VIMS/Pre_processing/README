Scripts for pre-processing, mainly generating input files.

hgrid.*:
0) generate *.2dm in SMS, remove isolated nodes, check for duplicated nodes (should be none)
* improve hgrid (remove skew/small elements): RiverMeshTools/RiverMapper/RiverMapper/improve_hgrid.py

*) Load bathymetry, see Bathy_edit/DEM_loading/README

*) Optional: force thalweg depth
  1) generate a *.2dm from thalweg points, redistribute with 100 m
  2) /sciclone/data10/feiye/schism_py_pre_post_hard_copy/schism_py_pre_post/Grid/force_thalweg.py


*) use the stofs3d-atl-driver.py to generate individual inputs

*) Inputs not included in the driver yet:
flux.th: see River/
TEM_1.th: seems no more temperature for St. Laurence River as of Apr, 2024, use ambient temperature in bctides.in as a temporary fix.
hotstart: see Hotstart/README, especially on incorporating aviso into eta2 in hotstart.nc
Nudge:
Bnd_th_nc: hycom-based inputs are straightforward; see Bnd_th_nc/elev2D_aviso/ for incorporating aviso into elev2D.th.nc
sflux: see Sflux/ on how to generate sflux files based on HRR/GFS/ERA5

*) see Hotstart/download_hycom.py on how to download hycom
