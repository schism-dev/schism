*gen_sourcesink.py*
This script is used to generate source/sink th files for hindcast.
This script depends on pyschism

If you have pre-downloaded NWM products,
you can create a sub-folder and link the necessary data to avoid downloading,
then change the cache folder in gen_sourcesink.py, e.g.:
cache = pathlib.Path('./NWM_v2.1')
