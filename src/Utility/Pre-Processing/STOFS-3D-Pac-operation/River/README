1. extract data for four stations from file usgs_river.****:
    link usgs_river.**** to usgs_river.txt
    python riverOB_extract_stations_pacific.py
   This will generate four files:
   usgs_station_14105700.txt  
   usgs_station_14211720.txt  
   usgs_station_14220500.txt  
   usgs_station_14243000.txt 
   BON.Flow-Out.Ave.1Hour.1Hour.txt

2. generate flux.th (daily data):
   In addtion to four files from step1, data for Fraser river should also need to be linked to the current directory:
   BC_08MF005_hourly_hydrometric.csv
   then run python script: python riverOB_gen_fluxth_new.py

3. generate TEM_1.th (daily data):
   Since we only have obs at Willamette and Dalles, temperature data at Dalles will be used for Lewis and Cowlitz.
   Linear regression is used at Fraser river to get water T, so sflux_air_1.0001.nc is need.

   run python script: python riverOB_gen_temp_1_new.py yyyy-mm-dd-hh
