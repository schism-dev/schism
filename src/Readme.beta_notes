Changes in param.[in,nml] and main parameter inputs for other modules:

Github versions:

8083cfa (Nov. 10, 2020): added option for transport solver only ('itransport_only');
7e9ff0a (Aug 20, 2020): added two options (selected by 'i_hmin_airsea_ex') for locally turning off heat/salt exchange.
      i_hmin_airsea_ex=1: exchange turned off if local grid depth<hmin_airsea_ex
      i_hmin_airsea_ex=2: exchange turned off if local water depth<hmin_airsea_ex
      This replaces the change made by adde1aa (July 8, 2020): added a new parameter 'hmin_airsea_ex' (min total water depth for heat/salt exchange);
2f7bab1 (Jun 28,2020): reorganized ICM process (rates/fluxes) and added output flag in param.nml.

1477780 (May 8, 2020): changed sediment.in to sediment.nml (and made parameters lower case: BEDLOAD_COEFF, 
      NEWLAYER_THICK,IMETH_BED_EVOL, SAND_SD50=>Sd50, SAND_ERATE=>Erate, SED_TYPE=>iSedtype,
      SAND_SRHO=>Srho, SAND_WSED=>Wsed, SAND_TAU_CE=>tau_ce, sed_morph_fac=>morph_fac,
      poro_cst=>porosity);
aaf1306 (April 4, 2020): added hybrid ELM transport parameters: ielm_transport, max_subcyc;
eb00a00 (Mar 31, 2020): add 12th tracer model (USE_DVD of Klingbeil); if invoked, make sure: flag_ic(12)=0, and set b.c. flag and nudging option to 0;
cd9664a (Mar 16, 2020): [1st PR from Baptiste Mengual] added iof_sed(12:15) for new SED code. In sediment.in: 
                        new options for various parameters and a few new parameters;
                        sed_morph=1 requires imorphogrid.gr3 (a scale applied to depth change at each node);
                        also morp factors are replaced by a single 'sed_morph_fac' fro all classes;
73f7451 (Jan 14, 2020): changed ifltype=3 to be consistent with '5' (i.e., now the amp/phases should be variable along open bnd);
59741d4 (Jan 9, 2020): added another pre-proc flag 'ipre2' for more diagnostic outputs (can be used with >1 CPU; stops
                       after outputs);
4e2eb86 (Dec 11, 2019): added optional flags 'iadjust_mass_consv0' to enforce mass conservation for each of (11) tracer models; 
2648090 (Dec 1, 2019): added 'vclose_surf_frac' for correcting vertical vel/flux;
5ff2198 (Nov 17, 2019): added 'level_age(:)' if USE_AGE (AGE module revamped);
05b0099 (Sep 11, 2019): pre-pended in/out dirs, and all outputs are now in outputs/. Name changes: 
         fort.11-> fatal.error, flux.dat ->flux.out, total.dat->total.out, total_TR.dat->total_TR.out,
         fort.33->JCG.out, fort.17->subcycling.out;
f69ca44 (Sep 9, 2019): updated nc libs in GOTM3 make;
---------------------------------------------------------------
SVN versions:
R5217: replaced bottom friction coefficient output with bottom stress vector output;
R5204: added an option 'ibtrack_openbnd' - ibtrack_openbnd=0 recovers old results, but try '1';
R5191: fixed a bug in iwind_form;
R5183: Allowed junk values (-9999) in .nc under inu_[MOD]=2 - code will not nudge tracers 
       to those values. So 1 way to avoid nudging for a tracer is to set its nudged values to -9999;
R5180: add an option flag 'iunder_deep' and restored 'hw_depth' and 'hw_ratio' under iunder_deep/=0;
R5168: changed to param.nml (3 sections: CORE, OPT, SCHOUT). Renamed the following:
   shapiro ->shapiro0; ibcc ->ibc; itransport ->ibtp; cpp_lon ->slam0; cpp_lat ->sfea0; 
   bfric ->nchi; latitude ->rlatitude; coriolis ->coricoef; 
   turb_met ->mid (must use ''); turb_stab ->stab (must use ''); slvr_output_spool ->moitn0;
   mxitn ->mxitn0; tolerance ->rtol0; hotout ->nhot; hotout_write ->nhot_write;
   consv_check ->iflux; depth_zsigma ->h_bcc1; 
   ic_[MOD] -> flag_ic(:); inu_[MOD] ->inu_tr(:)
   All output flags (iof_ and iout_sta, nspool_sta,nhot,nhot_write) changed and moved 
   to SCHOUT section;
R5165: removed 'iPh' in icm.in (and replaced it with ICM_PH);
R5131: added 'impose_net_flux' (if nws=2 and impose_net_flux/=0, read in net surface heat flux as 'dlwrf' 
       (Downward Long Wave) in sflux_rad (solar radiation is still used separately), and if 
        PREC_EVAP is on, also read in net P-E as 'prate' (Surface Precipitation Rate) in sflux_prc);
R5125: added 'vnh[1,2] and vnf[1,2]' (vertical nudging); final relax is dt times the sum of horizontal and
       vertical relax. Use this e.g. to restore near surface;
R5123: added 'niter_shap' (# of iterations with Shapiro filter);
R5114: added 'i_prtnftl_weno' (option for writing nonfatal errors on invalid temp. or salinity for density);
R5049: added dbte and other outputs in ANALYSIS module;
R5032: added a new output (if ICM): ICM_DIN and ICM_PON
R5028: renamed sflux*.nc with an extra '0' to allow up to 9999 stacks (use sflux_rename.pl to rename)
R5017: added a new output (if ICM): ICM_PrmPrdt (primary production).
R5001: added a new output (if USE_SED): 'SED_TSC' (total suspended concentration).
       The corresponding global array is total_sus_conc(nvrt,npa) and can be used if USE_SED;
R4998: added iwind_form=1 (Hwang stress formulation);
R4970: WWM now requires hgrid_WWM.gr3 (same as hgrid.gr3 if pure triangular; 
       use split_quads_wwm.f90 to convert for mixed grids; no B.C. part needed). 
       Update 'FILEGRID' in .nml (GRID section);
R4947: WWM added 'MEVEG, LSOUBOUND, LACCEL'
R4904: changed nudging input format (inu_*=2) to reduce size (add_map_nudge.m to convert old);
R4892: added 'h[1,2]_bcc';
R4811: wwminput.nml (removed ISOURCE, LEXPORT_*, PARAMWRITE in &BOUC and a few others; renamed MDC, MSC);
R4772: added iwbl=2 (wave boundary layer formulation by Soulsby, 1997) (USE_WWM), c/o Kevin Martins;
R4697: added 'nrampwafo, drampwafo, turbinj' (matters only USE_WWM);
R4672: ics=2 can now work with ncor/=1;
R4644: nws=3 is now the option for coupling to atmos models;
R4636: added 'h_ml0','salt_ice','salt_water' in ice.nml;
R4634: added outputs 'ICE_net_heat_flux', 'ICE_fresh_water', 'ICE_top_T' (if USE_ICE);

R4405: removed parameters: ihydlg, hw_depth, hw_ratio;
R4403: removed all '.6?' in output name list and appended '_side' and '_elem' for native outputs;
R4309: added 'gen_wsett' if USE_GEN for settling vel.
R4207: moved starting time info from sflux_inputs.txt and bctides.in to param.in. 
       sflux_inputs.txt now must NOT have this info (i.e. usually empty with only section headers);
       The 1st line of bctides.in is now for comments only.
       Changes in param.in: sim_[year,month,day]->start_[year,month,day] (integers); 
       removed sim_[minute,second]; 'start_hour' as double; added 'utc_start' (double);
R4116: changed all binary inputs to netcdf: *_[23]D.th =>*_[23]D.th.nc; [MOD]_nu.in =>[MOD]_nu.nc,
       hotstart.in => hotstart.nc. New version now needs netcdf4.4* and higher to compile 
       (also you only need -lnetcdff on some systems, not -lnetcdf).
R4025: added ICE module nc outputs (ICE_*) if USE_ICE
R4009: reinstated 'nramp_elev' (for ihot/=0)
R3976: added 'nstep_ice' (coupling with ice) if USE_ICE

R3563: removed 'inflow_mth' and output flags for Tsinghua group with USE_SED;
R3554: moved to newer svn repo versin 1.9.3  (columbia);
R3540: added PetSc as an option; no changes in param.in yet;
R3526: moved 2-phase mixture parameters to sediment.in; only 'inflow_mth' is retaind;
R3457: optional parameters from Tsinghua group: Two_phase_mix and output flags etc. Needed if USE_SED is on; 
R3399: added 'inflow_mth' (0: default uniform vel as flow b.c.);
R3362: moved 'rho0' and 'shw' to param.in;
R3286: removed 'nramp_elev' (not needed);
R3227: a new parameter 'slr_rate' (SLR rate) if USE_MARSH;
R3209: added a marsh migration model (inputs: marsh_init.prop, marsh_barrier.prop). New parameters:
       'mrsh.66';
R3098: removed 'nonhydro', 'ihydro_region';
R3087: added type '5' b.c. for elev. and vel (combination of tides and *[23]D.th). For
       vel, also '-5' is similar to '-4'; 
R3084: added two new parameters for under resolution in a b-clinic model:
       'hw_depth' and 'hw_ratio' (Hannah-Wright-like ratio & depth to detect under resolution);
R3080: added 'ieos_pres' (/=0: add hydrostatic pressure effects in EOS);
R3073: added a new flow b.c. (ifltype=-2, iettype=0) for discharge-stage relation. If invoked, need
       to input 4 coefficients of the polynomial function in bctides.in;
R3062: sediment.in: added erosional formulation options in SED3D (ierosion=0: Ariathurai & Arulanandan);
R3050: added a new paramter 'ihydlg' for hydrology;
R3017: added 2 options in SED2D (multi-class only): 'ISED_DUMP' (dumping/dredging), and 'MORPH_FAC' (morph acceleration);
R2956: hvis_coef0 now used for ihorcon=1,2 (no hvis_coef.gr3); 'shapiro' only needed if ishapiro=1;
       added ishapiro=-1 option (with shapiro.gr3) for transitioning between eddying and non-eddying regimes;
R2953: sediment.in: added dumping/dredging option in SED3D (ised_dump);
R2947: quads added in SED3D;
R2936: restored Shapiro filter as an option: 'ishapiro' and 'shapiro'. This option is normally used
       with indvel=ihorcon=0;
R2935: new parameters, 'rearth_pole', 'rearth_eq', 'iupwind_mom', 'hvis_coef0'; removed 'cdh'. In addition, 
       ihorcon=2 for bi-harmonic viscosity; hvis coefficients are specified in hvis_coef.gr3
       if ihorcon=1, and hvis_coef0 if ihorcon=2;
R2875: sediment.in, added a new parameter 'relath';
R2863: add nws=5,6 options (inputs: UVP.nc or UVP_direct.nc);
R2830: reinstate 'xlsc0' (mixing length scale for b.c.) as a parameter in param.in;
R2820: sediment.in, a parameter 'depo_scale' (scaling for depositional flux);
R2800: sediment.in, replaced 'bc_for_weno' by 'ised_bc_bot' (1: Warner's bottom b.c.; 2: Tsinghua Univ). 
       Hard-coded 3 parameters: g,vonKar,rhom;
R2796: exposed tolerances for implicit TVD in param.in: 'eps1_tvd_imp' and 'eps2_tvd_imp';
R2792: added 'ieos_type' for type of Eq. of State used (0: original UNESCO; 1: linear function of T ONLY). If
       ieos_type=1, needs two new parameters: eos_[a,b] for linear function;
R2789: added 'sed_morph_time' in sediment.in;
R2768: restored Manning's friction option (bfric=-1) and related 'hmin_man'. Note that if you use this
       option, Manning's formula will be applied to ALL prisms including 3D ones;
R2687: (1) 'ntracers' replaced by that for each tracer model: ntracer_gen, ntracer_age, sed_class, eco_class 
           (for ICM it's hardwired to 23);
       (2) icst repaced by 'ic_TEM' and 'ic_SAL' (and they must be same); 
           i.c. flags for other tracer models are ic_[MOD]. The inputs for T,S are not changed (ts.ic etc),
           but for other tracers, it's [MOD]_hvar_[ID].ic or [MOD]_vvar_[ID].ic, where [ID] are local tracer #;
       (3) the transport method for all tracers is given by 'itr_met' (which replaces iupwind_t);
       (4) nudging option flags are now: inu_[MOD] (including T,S). The relax. inputs are: [MOD]_nudge.gr3.
           Type '2' inputs are [MOD]_nu.in, and step is 'step_nu_tr';
       (5) Output name changes for other tracers: [MOD]_[ID].6?. In general, model name is added to the old names
           (see param.in for other names);
       (5) removed: flag_model,flag_ic, iupwind_t,inu_st, inu_tr, step_nu, ntracers
       (6) changes in names of .th: [MOD]_[ID].th (for all tracers and type 1 b.c.; temp.th->TEM_1.th, 
           salt.th->SAL_1.th); [MOD]_3D.th (includes all local tracers in it for type 4 b.c., but all of these
           must use same time step!), and so
           temp3D.th->TEM_3D.th, salt3D.th->SAL_3D.th. msource.th should include _all_ tracers if enabled
           (e.g. GEN,  AGE);
       (7) In addition formats are changed for bctides.in and hotstart, if tracer modules are enabled (use combine_hotstart6.f90);
R2650: removed 'flimiter' and 'flimiter2' - TVD options need to be set in Makefile.local now;
R2648: removed 'tvd_mid*' (option for TVD formulations);
R2581: indvel=0 now works with quad/tri. The only remaining non-working option is inunfl=1;
R2559: removed 'inter_st' (ELM transport);
R2552: added ramp-up flags for source/sinks (nramp_ss and dramp_ss) if if_source=1;
R2549: removed ELM transport option (iupwind_t=0);
R2266: new format from quads2/. Obsolete parameters are listed near the end. Also quads does not work
       with indvel<=0. vgrid.in is
       now required even for 2D model (1 layer). Have not worked on any of other modules yet;
       Changed parameters: (1) bfric=-1 is removed (for 2D sides, log formula is used which assumes the total depth as the BBL);

R2237: depth.61 output redefined as the _change_ in depth from initial condition (i.e. hgrid.gr3);
R2208: add a new output file 'bdrc.61';
R2040: format change for msource.th and wind.th (nws=1,4);
R18xx: added 2 new outputs from SED3D: bthk.66 (total bed thickness in meters) and
       bage.66 (total bed ages in sec);
R1842: add GOTM4.0 in make. More tests are needed.
R1801: added a new parameter for tracer nudging: step_nu_tr (for inu_tr=2, which requires an input tr_nu.in); also ICM sed. outputs: bdoc.66,bnh4.66,bno3.66,bpo4.66,bcod.66,sbdo.66,sbsa.66;
R1790: added a new option for momentum bottom b.c. ibottom_bc=1 recovers old results; =2: solve
       mom. eq. from surface to true bottom.
R1781: added age calculation. New outputs are age_[1..N].63. Method: set ntracers=2*N, where
       N is # of age tracers (the tracer array is [c_1..c_N a_1..a_N], and age_i=a_i/c_i). 
       All i.c. =0; c_i=1, c_j=0 (j/=i), a_[1..N]=0 at relevant bnd(s), and itrtype=0 at ocean bnd;
R1699: .th now can have its own time step, but MUST start at t=0! Previously only wind.th can have its own dt;
R1587: added a new parameter: ishapiro_violation. If =0, no Shapiro filter violation check will be done.
R1577: (not param.in per se) added a few new parameters in vgrid.in for ivcor (types of z-coord. systems; 2 for SZ)
R1534: (merged with branch/selfe_opt1) tvd_mid, tvd_mid2, flimiter, flimiter2 should only be changed if CHOOSE_TVD is turned on;
R1495: added a new parameter (dzb_decay<=0) for friction option bfric=1.
       Under this option, Cd is calculated from log law when dzb>=dzb_min, and 
       Cdmax=Cd(dzb=dzb_min). When dzb<dzb_min, Cd=Cdmax*exp[dzb_decay*(1-dzb/dzb_min)].
       e.g, if dzb_decay=-3.4539, Cd(dzb=dzb_min/3)=0.1*Cdmax. Note that the old
       bfric=1 option can be recovered by setting dzb_decay=0;
R1460: corrected mis-spelt 'latitude';
R1405: 1 new parameter (hmin_radstress) used only for rad. stress calculation;
R1382: relaxed check for rmaxvel;
R1359: removed 'ishapiro'; it's set internally instead;
R1354: 1 new parameter (cdh) needed when ihorcon/=0 - land friction coeeficient.
R1350: 1 new parameter (ishapiro) to do pre-proc for Shapiro filter.
R1343: 2 new outputs for SED2D: cflsed.61 and qav.62
R1341: 2 new parameters: inv_atm_bnd, prmsl_ref (inverse barometric effect option for elev. b.c.)
R1302: Moved tracer parameters from bctides.in to param.in: itr_met,tvd_mid2,flimiter2,inu_tr
R1282: output bfmt rename as z0st; 
R1272: streamlined non-standard output section. All of these (bfmt,z0eq,z0cr,z0sw,z0wr,bpgr,wafo) 
       must be present in param.in;
R1089: removed mass_source
R1038: added new parameter cdsed.61 for SED2D
R849: remove obsolete parameter iwrite;
R841: added a new parameter 'mass_source' to bypass mass source in transport;
R812: ics=2 and inter_mom>0 works now;
R747: replacd Cdmax with dzb_min for bfric=1 (roughness). With dzb_min=0.5m, the max Cd's are: 0.0022 (z0=0.1mm), 
      0.0034 (z0=0.5mm), 0.0041 (z0=1mm), 0.0061 (z0=3mm), 0.0075 (z0=5mm), 0.0105 (z0=1cm);
R744: added SED2D output parameters;
R513: add 2D Manning formulation inside code; bfric=-1 is the new option (needs hmin_man and manning.gr3). 2D model
      must use this option.
R473: new parameter: if_source (for pt source/sink);
R348: new parameter: irouse_test. Also mdc2,msc2,iwbl, iharind, flag_ic, flag_model and sim_* now must be present (even when not used);
R300: 'hvel.65'-> 'hvel.67', 'vert.66'->'vert.69', 'temp.67'->'temp.70','salt.67'->'salt.70';
      added non-standard output option for internal arrays for generic use;
R292: added nramp_elev;
R250: removed 'testout'; added 'hvel.65', 'vert.66','temp.67', 'salt.67'
R192: msc, mdc changed to msc2, mdc2 
R180: added msc, mdc if WWM is used (same as MSC,MDC in .nml);
R158: new parameter: ihydraulics

Changes in wwminput.nml (WWM):
R4861: MSC, MDC, MESIN, LLIMT, LIMFAK restored
R3797: MSC, MDC changed to NUMSIG, NUMDIR; MESIN changed to ISOURCE (on/off); MELIM default is 1 (on). 
       removed: LLIMT, LIMFAK. Add 2 new sections: SIN4, SDS4;
R326: (1) &OUTP renamed &STATION; added &HISTORY
      (2) LMONO_IN, LMONO_OUT, LNAUTOUT moved to &PROC
      (3) LWXFN moved to &HISTORY
R192: (1) DMIN now linked to h0 in param.in;
      (2) &BOUC: GRIDTYPE changed to IGRIDTYPE (3: SELFE); BOUNDFORMAT chanegd to IBOUNDFORMAT;
      (3) &BOUC: added LPARMDIR (1D spectra only)
      (4) &WIND: LWINDFROMWWM may be used to read wind into WWM directly;
      (5) &ENGS: FRICC must >0
R??: (1) FRHIG --> FRHIGH
     (2) added LVECTOR, IVECTOR in NUM section (Sept. 11, 2011);

---------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in other inputs:
(20) R2684: bctides: combined T,S and tracers b.c. flags into 1 line;
(19) R2570: removed xlsc.gr3 as input (itur=3), and set it at 0.1;
(18) R2266: vgrid.in is now required for 2D model;
(17) R2040: make all .th format consistent
            msource.th: all tracers are lumped into 1 line [ath3(1:nsources,1:2+ntracers,...)]; 
            wind.th (nws=1,4): add time stamp;
(16) R1850: SED3D input changes: (a) removed bedthick_overall from sediment.in and 
                                 added bedthick.ic (.gr3 format); (b)in addition, also need bed_frac_*.ic.
(15) R1813: renamed vvd.dat as vvd.in;
(14) R1699: .th now can have its own time step, but MUST start at t=0! Previously only wind.th can have its own dt;
(13) R1302: Moved tracer parameters from bctides.in to param.in: itr_met,tvd_mid2,flimiter2,inu_tr
(12) R1264:  SED2D part added to hotstart. Use combine_hotstart5.f90 for combining.
             hotstart.in is backward compatible for pure Hydro (i.e. no ICM or SED2D);
(11) R1225: changed tvd.gr3 and fluxflag.gr3 to .prop format;
(10) R1222: appled the change in R1219 to elev. and vel. nudging as well;
(9) R1219: changed relax. const. definition (suggested by Ben and Brett). The values in 
           [s,t,tracer]_nudg.gr3 will be multiplied by dt to get the final relax. const.
           One approach to calculate the values in these .gr3 files is: -log(0.1)/T90/86400, where
           T90 is the 90% decay time in days;
(8) R1019: fluxflag.gr3 now takes an arbitrary # of regions from -1,0...M. The code
           (with consv_check=1) will calculate the flux between 2 region numbers with difference=1, excluding region -1;
(7) R934: If running on Stampede, need an input 'die.stam' (temp. fix for cluster hang problem);
(6) R835: fluxflag.gr3 can now take an arbitrary # of regions from 0...M. The code
          (with consv_check=1) will calculate the lower triangle of the fluxes matrix. 
(5) R513: if bfric=-1 (2D model), needs manning.gr3 (Manning's n);
(4) R473: if if_source=1, need: source_sink.in, vsource.th, vsink.th, 
          and msource.th (volume sources and sinks are combined in the
          code, which is then ramped up with a rate 2x slower than main ramp if nramp=1; 
          no ramp for mass source);
(3) R3??: elev3D.th renamed as elev2D.th;
(2) R86: tvd.gr3 is needed if iupwind_t=2;
(1) R??: if ihydraulics/=0, need hydraulics.in 

---------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in outputs:
(1) R??: 3D profiles for station outputs;
(2) R147: commented out (1);
(3) R304: added non-standard outputs (*.67 etc) that users can also use.
          For side- or center-based outputs, combine_output6 needs sidecenters.gr3

(4) R881: add timer_comp() for generic use in compution-only portion of a routine for load balance analysis etc.
(5) R964: hotstart outputs changed to include additional arrays for ICM; hotstart.in is 
          backward compatible if USE_ICM is not on. Use combine_hotstart4.f90 for combining.
(6) R1469; consolidated many output files to reduce I/O footprint;
(7) R1776: hotstart outputs changed to include SED[23]D arrays; use combine_hotstart5.f90 for combining.

(61) R3797: new WWM-III source code, LLIMT was removed and ISOURCE was added for simplification of the source terms switches
       WWM-III supports now WWIII, WAM and SWAN physics, where ST4 from WWIII is the default physics as used at NCEP/NOAA and ECMWF in the future. 
       The whole code was rewritten in terms efficiency, like chache locality + arrays allignement has been improved and so the scalibility of the code
       ASPAR_LOCAL from 1-10 was introduced to have influence of memory locality, e.g. for ASPAR_LOCAL_LEVEL = 1 as much as possible is precomputed 
       and using ASPAR_LOCAL_LEVEL = 10 u have basically everything computed on the fly. What the best is for the certain system and problem can be tested 
       by try and error for small computer systems and smaller problems ASPAR_LOCAL_LEVEL = 1-4 and for large scale problems 5-10. 
(62) R3932: Hydro/lap.F90, line 1663 has Mbound issue. Aron fixed it by declaring D[XY](N) in DCOPY and DDOT.
(63) R3945: switch to netcdf outputs; saved last binary output version as branches/v5.4
(64) R3976: added a new option for settling vel. (Richard Hofmeister).
(65) R4009: fixed a bug with ihot=2 introduced between R3285 and R3286 due to the removal of nramp_elev.

(72) R4500: revamped sediment flux module inside ICM
(73) R4549: Changed ptrack3.f90 behavior when a particle hits horizontal bnd or wet/dry bnd - 
            it'll now be reflected back as in LTRAN. This avoids particles being stuck
(74) R4644: nws=3 is now option for coupling to atmos models
(75) R4699: Carten Lemmon changed ParMetis-3.1-Sep2010/METISLib/stdheaders.h and ParMetis-3.1-Sep2010/ParMETISLib/stdheaders.h
        (added __clang__)
(76) R4729: Aron Roland changed ParMetis-3.1-Sep2010/Makefile.in and added '-D...':

(83) R4968: quads added for WWM
(84) R4984: branches/coriolis3 experimented using node vel to compute Coriolis to reduce
            inertial instability. Didn't seem to make much difference.
(85) R4994: allows volume sources/sinks to be specified more than once at same element 
            (code will accumulate). The corresponding mass source concentration 
            will take one of the specified values (no summation).
(86) R5005: Aron fixed an issue with shallow-water sources in WWM
(87) R5028: allow up to 9999 stacks for sflux*.nc

(91) R5178: fix bug of saturate DO in ICM
(92) R5187: incorporated dry bnd treatment from bndry (c/o Jens Wyrwa). However, to get 
            good volume conservation it's best to keep all open flow bnd's wet all the time as before;
(93) R5191: fixed a bug in iwind_form (accidentally re-init'ed after reading);
(94) R5202: fixed a bug on negative ICM tracer concentration - check negative values before sending 
            back to hydro.
(95) R5204: a new option to control behavior of btrack when trajectory hots an open bnd 
            (set vel=0 and exit). Goal is to eventually use this as default;

git versions:
(96) 64b7181: fixed an efficiency issue and added nc checks in ptrack3 (c/o Marcel Rieker)
(97) 2138e77: Fixed a major bug introduced during reshuffling of _init for PDAF: need to call nodavel before sflux, as (uu2,vv20 are needed there.
(98) 5ff2198: revamped AGE module. B.C. now all should use 0. Only 0 and 1 should be used in AGE_hvar_[1:ntr/2].ic, 
              where ntr is @ of age tracers, and the code will 'hold' concentration at 1 at those prisms 
              (level specified in param.nml) that have 1 as i.c. I.C. in AGE_hvar_[ntr/2+1:ntr].ic should =0.
              Injecting '1' at dry elem's is allowed but results may be harder to interpret.
(99) 6cec698: bug fix for spherical coord in WWM (around dateline);
(100) c46c7bd (Feb 14, 2020): Fei tweaked WENO solver (wrt upwind);

(109) 33fb37f (Jun 30, 2020): fixed a bug in ielm_transport (Fei Y.).
(110) 55910d1 (July 31, 2020; via branch mem_leak_nc4): reverted the change in schism_io (close/open 
               nc output after/b4 each write, to accommodate PDAF's flexible mode), as this has caused a 
               lot of mem leaking (discovered by Nicole C. when testing ICM).
(111) eaf9093 (Aug 2020): Baptiste M. modified the computation of the bottom shear stress 
              under combined waves and currents in SED3D
(112) 4ac56df (Aug 2020): Paul Ryan and Claire Trenham (CSIRO) fixed some init array issues in hydro and WWM.
(113) 7e9ff0a (Aug 20, 2020): Fei Y fixed a msource bug (init of msource at 0 at elem's not in source_sink.in
                              led to ice rain;
(114) f311026 (Aug. 27, 2020): reverted init of msource to 0 for tracers other than T,S, 
      c/o Nicole Cai. Using ambient values for other tracers can lead to artifitial and additional accumulation of nutrients e.g.

(115) 00b6f16 (Nov. 9, 2020): PR #21 from Kijin merged (SED): changed method to compute near bottom vel for LSC2.
(116) 8083cfa (Nov. 10, 2020): added option for transport solver only (itransport_only)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
gnu make system:

To use Makefile, three files are needed:
mk/Make.defs.local, mk/Make.defs.config, and src/Makefile
The file mk/Make.defs.local should be written depending on different environment. 
Write your own env into mk/Make.defs.<your env name> (see mk/Make.defs.* from others as a reference),
 and copy or symlink it to mk/Make.defs.local. svn ci the first file (not the 2nd file). You can then toggle on/off
 modules using mk/Make.defs.local.

In addition, python is also needed.

To add a new CPP or module, need to update all 3 files (in the order shown above).
